 # Introduction

 Despite

advances

in

our

exploration

of

the

Universe,

we

have

yet

to

determine

whether

 extraterrestrial life exists. At the same time, even defining life itself remains one of the most

 enigmatic challenges in science1. Our only known example is terrestrial life, thought to have

 evolved

from

a

common

ancestor

under

conditions

specific

to

Earth2–4.

Traditionally,

life

 detection missions have targeted highly specific biosignatures (chemical or physical indicators

 of life), while limiting the search space by relying on assumptions about life as we know it.

 The absence of a clear definition of life, coupled with the difficulty of interpreting the alien

 environments in which it might arise, has led to inconclusive outcomes.

 Two

notable

examples

of

ambiguous

biosignature

detections

within

our

Solar

System

are

 methane (CH4) in the Martian atmosphere and phosphine (PH3) in the Venusian atmosphere5,6.



Whilst it is clear that methane can be formed biologically via methanogens (microorganisms

 that generate methane)7, the biological processes thought to be involved in direct

phosphine

 production is less clear8. However, these gases are also chemically simple and can arise through

 abiotic

(non-biological)

processes,

such

as

volcanic

eruptions

and

geothermal

activity9,10.

 Complicating

matters,

both

molecules

are

reactive

and

can

be

unstable

in

planetary

 atmospheres, undergoing decomposition through ultraviolet photolysis, atmospheric chemistry,

 and

reactions

with

mineral

surfaces11–14. Scientists

have

speculated

about

biological

origins

 after

detecting

them

at

levels

that

purportedly

exceed

what

known

environmental

processes

 alone can easily sustain5,15. Yet the dynamic balance between production and destruction of

 these gases makes such speculation difficult to confirm16.

 Similar ambiguities apply to biosignature candidates detected beyond our Solar System. One

 prominent example is dimethyl sulfide (DMS, C2H6S), tentatively identified in the atmosphere

 2







 of the exoplanet K2-18b, located over 100 light-years away17. K2-18b is classified as a Hycean

 planet, a type of temperate world thought to host a subsurface ocean beneath a hydrogen-rich

 atmosphere18.

On

Earth,

DMS

can

be

produced

by

decomposition,

associated

with

marine

 microorganisms, explaining why it has been suggested as a biosignature candidate19. However,

 it

has

also

been

identified

in

abiotic

environments,

such

as

cometary

dust20,

and

can

be

 synthesized

under

prebiotic

laboratory

conditions21.

Disentangling

whether

these

candidate

 molecules

originate

from

biological

or

non-biological

sources

requires

quantifying

the

full

 range of environmental processes that could produce or destroy them, and the possibility that

 unfamiliar

forms

of

life

(potentially

radically

different

from

those

on

Earth)

might

be

 responsible for their presence. Given these many uncertainties, it remains difficult to assert that

 the

presence

of

simple

molecules

(whether

methane,

phosphine,

or

DMS)

provides

clear

 evidence of alien life22,23.

 There

is

a

growing

interest

in

“agnostic” life

detection

strategies:

methods

that

can

identify

 molecular signs of life without needing an exact understanding of what that life might look like,

 or how it might interact with a complex, poorly characterized environment24–26. One alternative

 approach

to

distinguish

between

abiotic

and

biotic

molecules

is

to

assign

them

complexity

 scores27. These scores are fixed for each molecule and do not depend on external conditions,

 such

as

the

environment

in

which

they

might

be detected

or

the

specific

alien

biochemistry

 from which they might arise. Because complexity scores are independent of such difficult-to-

quantify factors, they could be considered “agnostic biosignatures”. Herein we propose a new

 approach

to

life

detection,

which

utilizes

a

new

method

to

detect

evidence

of

selection

and

 evolution, intrinsic signatures of life, at the molecular level, see Fig. 1.

 Fig. 1: Schematic overview of deploying MA as an agnostic biosignature. Upcoming life

detection

missions

in

the

Solar

System

can

collect

samples

in

situ

and

predict

MA

scores

directly from MS data without the need for structural elucidation, which may be difficult for

unknown molecules in extraterrestrial environments. Space missions that use MSn can estimate

MA scores with the RecursiveMA algorithm. In the current paper, we show that space missions

that use MS1 (and optionally MSn) can infer MA scores with ML.

 Several

molecular

complexity

methods

have

been

proposed,

such

as

those

by

Bertz

and

 Böttcher, which aim to quantify the structural or informational richness of a molecule28,29. The

 Bertz complexity score, one of the earliest and most influential, incorporates features from both

 graph theory and information theory. It estimates molecular complexity by treating the number

 of graph invariants of a specified type and distinct heteroatoms in a molecular graph as discrete

 states

in

Shannon’s

formula

for

information

entropy.

The

Böttcher

score,

another

well-

4









 established

molecular

complexity

metric,

estimates

the

information

content

in

each

atom's

 microenvironment. It does so by assessing stereogenicity, the diversity of heavy atom and bond

 types,

and

chemical

equivalence29.

Both

scores

use

Shannon

entropy-based

approaches

to

 quantify the structural diversity of a molecule, independent of how it was built.

 More recently, a new approach has been developed from a theoretical framework known as

 assembly theory (AT), which seeks to explain how complex objects arise through processes of

 selection and evolution30. In this framework, the amount of selection (or assembly) is a function

 of the amount of a given object found in the environment and its

assembly. To quantify the

 degree of selection required to construct an ensemble of molecules, AT utilizes the assembly

 index and the copy number of the observed objects, where the amount of selection is quantified

 by the assembly of the ensemble (𝐴):

 𝑁 𝐴 = ∑ 𝑒𝑎𝑖 ( 𝑖𝜖𝑛𝑖>1

𝑛𝑖 𝑁𝑇

)

(1)

 where 𝑎𝑖 is the assembly index of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ object, 𝑛𝑖 is its copy number of the 𝑖𝑡ℎ object, 𝑁 is the

 total number of unique objects, 𝑒 is Euler’s number, and 𝑁𝑇 is the total number of objects in

 the ensemble. The equation captures the delicate interplay between assembly index and copy

 number.

 Here, the object’s assembly index is defined as the length of its shortest construction pathway—

that is, the minimum number of discrete steps required to build it from basic building blocks

 and objects in the assembly pool (i.e. intermediate objects produced in earlier steps that can be

 reused in subsequent ones) (Fig. 2a)30. When the object is a molecule, its

assembly index is

 termed molecular assembly (MA). Because MA depends only on the shortest path, and this can

 5













 be

measured

experimentally,

this

approach

to

molecular

complexity

gives

a

more

objective

 approach

which

is

less

susceptible

to

false

positives,

see

Fig.

2a30.

When

working

with

a

 mixture of molecules, their assembly score is termed their joint molecular assembly (JMA),

 which represents the shortest pathway to construct all molecules in the ensemble30,31. Whereas

 Bertz and Böttcher quantify molecular properties using entropy-based methods without regard

 to construction history, MA uses algorithmic approaches to compute the shortest construction

 pathway, capturing history-dependent complexity.

 By emphasizing the history of molecular construction, MA aims to offer a deeper foundational

 link to life detection and origin-of-life studies. The core premise is that a molecule with a high

 MA

(i.e.

one

that

requires

a

long

construction

pathway)

is

statistically

unlikely

to

form,

 especially in large quantities (i.e. high copy number), through random abiotic processes. On a

 barren

world,

the

exploration

of

molecular

space

would

likely

be

undirected,

favoring

the

 spontaneous formation of simpler molecules of lower complexity (i.e. molecules with low MA)

 leading

to

combinatorial

explosion.

However,

under

selective

pressures,

this

exploration

 becomes more directed, favoring the emergence of increasingly complex molecules with longer

 construction

pathways

and

greater

shared

historical

contingencies

(i.e.

molecules

that

share

 more assembly pool objects with one another). The most plausible source of such pressures is

 biology,

which

evolved

to

encode

information

that

constrains

chemical

reaction

networks,

 guiding the reliable synthesis of highly specific and complex molecules. Consistent with this

 idea, experimental findings suggest that molecules with MA scores above specific thresholds

 may serve as reliable indicators of biology27.

 To

successfully

utilize

MA

as

an

agnostic

biosignature,

we

need

experimental

methods

to

 quantify the MA of molecules in an unknown sample. Many upcoming missions—including

 6







 the

Europa

Lander,

the

Enceladus

Orbilander,

and

the

Dragonfly

expedition

to

Titan—will

 carry

mass

spectrometers

to

analyze

molecular

samples

directly

on

planetary

surfaces32.

In

 these

remote

environments,

where

structural

elucidation

is

infeasible

due

to

unfamiliar

 molecules

or

limited

instrument

resolution,

the

ability

to

measure

molecular

complexity

 directly

from

mass

spectrometry

(MS)

data

will

be

critical.

Among

existing

approaches

to

 molecular complexity, MA can be measured by a range of techniques, including multi-stage

 mass spectrometry (MSn)33. In MSn, a parent molecule is sequentially fragmented into smaller

 ions through collision-induced dissociation, and this process is repeated across multiple stages

 until the smallest fragments can no longer be broken down. The resulting fragmentation tree

 reveals

the

shortest

pathway

of

assembly

steps

required

to

reconstruct

the

parent

molecule,

 allowing the MA to be directly measured33. To operationalize this approach, the RecursiveMA

 algorithm

was

developed

to

successfully

quantify

MA

scores

directly

from

high-resolution,

 MSn data (Fig. 1). In contrast, scores like Bertz and Böttcher lack this physical connection to

 experimental

data,

as

they

rely

on

global,

entropy-inspired

properties

that

do

not

reflect

 stepwise construction or fragmentation, i.e. there is no physical technique that can be used to

 measure the complexity of the sample directly unless the structure has already been determined.

 An effective agnostic biosignature must satisfy two key criteria: it must be interpretable (can

 distinguish between biology and non-biology), and it must be experimentally determinable. As

 previously

outlined,

MA

satisfies

both.

First,

it

is

interpretable:

it

exhibits

threshold

scores

 above which molecules are unlikely to arise abiotically, as they suggest a history of directed

 construction by life27. Second, it can be measured: this is done by applying RecursiveMA on

 MSn data33. Importantly, this does not require structural elucidation, making it highly suitable

 for

unknown

compounds

in

extraterrestrial

settings.

For

these

reasons,

MA

has

been

 specifically proposed as a tool for agnostic life detection27.

 7







 Considering

this,

an

ideal

strategy

would

be

to

deduce

MA

directly

from

MSn

data

using

 RecursiveMA, ensuring full mechanistic interpretability: that is, understanding exactly how the

 MA score is derived from the combination of fragments that reconstruct the parent molecule

 in the fewest steps, see Fig. 1. However, RecursiveMA cannot be used to measure MA from

 single-stage mass spectrometry (MS1) data directly, because it requires fragment information

 across multiple stages33. Even when MSn data are available, limited fragmentation stages, poor

 fragmentation behavior, or limited mass resolution, may prevent accurate MA determination.

 In such cases, it is worth exploring whether machine learning (ML) could assist in predicting

 MA scores from available MS data (Fig. 1)34. To investigate this possibility, we evaluated the

 prediction of MA from MS1 data acquired under conditions like those proposed for upcoming

 missions to Titan and Europa. These missions will use gas chromatography-mass spectrometry

 (GC-MS)

with

electron

ionization

(EI),

which

produces

MS1

data.

Because

algorithmic

 reconstruction of MA prediction is not possible with MS1, we conducted a proof-of-concept

 study to assess whether ML models could learn to predict MA directly from MS1 data (Fig.

 1)34.

 In this study, we trained ML models on data from the NIST (National Institute of Standards

 and Technology) Chemistry WebBook (Standard Reference Database [SRD] 69)35, a curated

 repository

of

EI

GC-MS1

data.

We

found

that

XGBoost36,

a

gradient-boosted

decision

tree

 model, substantially outperforms baseline models34. The model also generalizes well to other

 MS1 databases. Using simulated MSn data, we further show that model accuracy depends on

 consistent instrument parameters (such as ionization energy), highlighting the importance of

 using

standardized

data.

Taken

together,

these

findings

suggest

that

when

algorithmic

 approaches

are

not

feasible,

ML

models

trained

on

relevant,

standardized

MS

data

offer

a

 viable

alternative

for

in

situ

estimation

of

molecular

assembly.

This

approach

can

help

 8





 prioritize, in real time, which regions should be further explored, and which samples should be

 cached for future return to Earth.

 Rationale for selecting MA index over conventional molecular complexity scores

 In this section, we use theoretical reasoning and large-scale analysis to identify MA as the most

 suitable

candidate

for

agnostic

biosignature

detection,

based

on

its

interpretability.

We

first

 compare

how

three

candidate

approaches

(Bertz,

Böttcher,

and

MA)

scale

with

number

of

 bonds (NB) by plotting this information for the set of molecules used in our ML model (i.e. for

 all

molecules

with

MS1

data

in

the

NIST

SRD

database)

(Fig.

2b-d).

We

found

that

Bertz

 increases more than linearly with NB (superlinear growth), Böttcher increases approximately

 linearly,

and

MA

increases

less

than

linearly

(sublinear

growth)

and

these

findings

were

 consistent when we examined databases larger than NIST SRD, see Table 1.

The

results

were

consistent

between

three

databases (NIST SRD, COCONUT 2.0, and PubChem).

 Bertz

and

Böttcher

have

variances

that

increase

with

increasing 𝑁𝐵 ,

as

evidenced

by

their

 funnel-shaped distributions in Fig. 2b-c. The theoretical bounds of MA scores also exhibit this

 feature, as shown by the two dotted red lines in Fig. 2d. However, the observed molecules do

 not exhibit such variances that increases with 𝑁𝐵 in their MA: with increasing 𝑁𝐵, we no longer

 find any molecules that adhere to the upper bound of 𝑀𝐴 = 𝑁𝐵 − 1, because large molecules

 form in high copy numbers more readily if they reuse assembly pool objects that keep their

 9









 shortest pathways of construction minimal, see Fig. 2d. These observations suggest that MA

 captures more underlying structures and submolecular symmetries, while Bertz and Böttcher

 are sensitive to total number of bonds.



We next calculated the relative mean squared error (MSE) for simple baseline models (linear

 regression,

logarithmic

regression,

power

law,

and

polynomial

regression)

regressed

on

the

 weight of the molecule, the number of bonds in the molecule, the mass of the maximum peak

 in its spectra, and the number of peaks in its spectra (Supplementary Table 1). We note that

 structural

elucidation

is

required

to

determine

the

𝑁𝐵

and

molecular

weight

(MW)

of

a

 molecule, the latter of which is not always derivable from the MS1 data, given that the parent

 molecule

is

often

fragmented.

For

all

three

measures,

the models

regressed

on features

that

 require structural eludication (i.e. 𝑁𝐵 and MW) and predicted complexity better than features

 that

do

not

require

structural

elucidation

(i.e.

number

of

peaks

and

maximum

peak,

 Supplementary Table 1). This suggested that molecular complexity cannot be predicted well

 from

simple

baseline

models

applied

directly

to

MS1

data

alone,

and

highlighted

again

the

 overall motivation for our current study (Supplementary Table 1).

 It is difficult to interpret how Böttcher and Bertz scores scale; for example, it is unclear what a

 Bertz score of 4,000.17 means relative to scores of 40.23 or 400.09. In contrast, MA provides

 interpretabilities that scale: a molecule with an MA of 40 has a shortest pathway twice as long

 as a molecule with an MA of 20, see Fig. 2a as an example. Within the context of AT, the

 combinatorial spaces of physically plausible molecules in the absence of any selective bias is

 given

by

assembly

possible,

where

molecules

are

represented

by

their

shortest

construction

 paths30. With an increase in MA, the number of combinatorial construction operations leading

 to all physically plausible molecules increases exponentially. As an example, the molecule with

 10







 an MA of 40 has a vastly larger assembly possible space compared to the molecule with an

 MA of 20. The exponential expansion of assembly possible also allows for interpretation of

 MA

differences

considering

single

construction

steps

𝑎 → 𝑎 + 1 ,

where

𝑎

quantifies

an

 intermediate construction step, as the assembly possible expands less so with an MA from 10

 to 11 as compared to an MA from 20 to 21 (see Fig. 2a). In contrast, for given Böttcher and

 Bertz scores, it is difficult to quantify the potential combinatorial spaces of molecules as they

 calculate

complexity

based

on

additive

and

entropic

properties

of

molecular

substructures

 instead

of

path-dependent

features

in

assembly

spaces.

This

is

because

the

expansion

of

 combinatorial

space

of

molecules

cannot

be

interpreted

intuitively

with

Böttcher

and

Bertz

 scores whereas the scalable interpretability of MA has been investigated

across a variety of

 The

same

set

of

molecules

yield

substantially

different

ranges

across

the

three

different

 approaches, with maximum MA: 24, Böttcher: 911.25, and Bertz: 2,515.02, see Fig. 2. Because

 each complexity measure captures different molecular attributes, the molecules ranked as low

 or

high

in

complexity

vary

depending

on

the

metric.

Here,

Bertz

tends

to

classify

linear

 hydrocarbon chains with simple or no branching structures as low in complexity, and molecules

 with dense, intricate bonding as high in complexity. In contrast, Böttcher evaluates the local

 microenvironment of atoms, ranking molecules with multiple stereocenters and conformational

 flexibility as more complex, while considering rigid and achiral molecules (such as symmetric

 cages or fullerenes) as less complex. Meanwhile, MA considers how many steps are required

 to form molecules, and hence it ranks heterogeneous molecules with few reusable substructures

 as high in complexity, and molecules that can recursively reuse substructures in their assembly

 pools as low in complexity.



It is noteworthy that, when normalized for size, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are

 typically ranked as highly complex according to Bertz, but as having low complexity according

 to MA, see Fig. 2. PAHs are among the most abundant type of molecules in space, believed to

 comprise 15% of the interstellar carbon37. They are also widespread38, having been detected in

 interstellar

dust

(where

stars

and

planets

form)39,

in

meteorites40,

and

in

the

of

 Titan41.

The

untested

“PAH

world”

hypothesis

even

proposes

that

PAHs

facilitated

the

 synthesis of the first RNA molecules, potentially playing a major role in the origin of life42.

 Collectively,

these

observations

underscore

how

different

complexity

scores

can

result

in

 contrasting perspectives on molecules with significant astrobiological implications.

 We also chose to focus on MA because, as far as we know, it has been specifically developed

 for life detection methods, following experimental evidence suggesting that MA values above

 certain thresholds may strongly indicate the presence of life27. If such thresholds exist for MA,

 they may be linked to more intuitive scalability and the statistical improbability of observing a

 large “copy number” of any given high MA molecule by random, undirected processes. This

 improbability arises not only from the large number of assembly steps required to construct the

 molecule,

but

also

from

the

exponentially

larger space

of

similarly

complex

molecules

that

 could have been formed. We note that this copy number criterion is inherently satisfied in MS

 data, as modern instruments only detect molecules once a sufficiently large number of copies

 are present43 (Table 2c).

 Experimental

work

has

suggested

that

biological

samples

have

a

wider

distribution

of

MA

 values compared to abiotic samples, and that only biological samples produce MAs above a

 certain threshold (ca. 15)27. We investigated how well separating the COCONUT 2.0 database44

 into two groups of molecules based on MA thresholds of between 15 and 20 could similarly

 separate

the

molecules

into

the

same

two

groups

based

on

Bertz

and

Böttcher

scores

 (Supplementary Figs. 2 and 3). This analysis suggests that MA thresholds that have FPRs of

 close to zero, based on prior experimental work, cannot be as readily translated into Bertz and

 Böttcher thresholds without introducing FPRs in the range of 0.17 to 0.32 (depending on the

 MA threshold).

 The observations that reveal the relationship between Bertz and MA values for all molecules

 in the COCONUT 2.0 database44 are illustrated in Fig. 3. While there is a relationship between

 these scores (primarily due to all complexity scores in general becoming higher with increasing

 molecular size), we still see significant discrepancies. For example, the three molecules shown

 14







 all

have

the

same

Bertz

score

of

around

1,000,

with

molecule

#2

representing

the

average

 situation with an MA score of 15. However, molecule #3 has an MA of 25, which is more than

 four

times

higher

than

the

MA

score

of

6

for

molecule

#1.

This

means

that

even

though

 molecule #3 requires more than four times the number of assembly steps to form its shortest

 pathway

compared

to

molecule

#1,

they

still

obtain

the

same

Bertz

score

(see

the

shortest

 pathways for these molecules drawn out in Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4).

b,

Three

molecules

with

similar Bertz scores, but with either low, intermediate, or high MA scores.

 Altogether, these example molecules in Fig. 3 illustrate that Bertz scores can be particularly

 high

for

periodic

molecules

with

many

bonds,

even

when

their

structural

heterogeneity

is

 limited. Molecule #1 (benzo[j]fluoranthene, BjF, which has been detected in meteorites45) has

 a Bertz score of around 1,000, which corresponds to an average MA of around 15, which would

 be high enough to warrant consideration as a biosignature.

BjF

has

a

true

MA

of

6,

lower

Fig.

4.

For

this,

we

start

with

a

set

of

highly

symmetrical

 hydrocarbon molecules—dodecane (the largest organic molecule discovered to date on Mars)46,

 cubane,

coronene

(present

in

meteorites

and

the

interstellar

medium

(ISM))47,

and

 buckminsterfullerene

(also

present

in

meteorites

and

the

ISM)48,49—and

then

break

their

 symmetry by adding “defect” atoms, see Fig 4. Here, Böttcher scores increase significantly,

 while Bertz scores and MA increase only slightly. In this demonstration, MA and Bertz are

 sensitive to both full and submolecular symmetries, whereas Böttcher is sensitive to the full

 molecular symmetry and largely unaffected by submolecular symmetries.



To

further

examine

the

role

of

MA

in

life

detection,

we

investigated

how

well

the

three

 approaches

distinguished

between

similarly

sized

molecules

from

the

PubChem

and

 COCONUT 2.0 databases (Fig. 5)44,50. In a broad manner, the PubChem database45 can serve

 as a proxy for what molecules are possible given the environmental constraints on planet Earth,

 whereas

the

COCONUT

2.0

database44

can

serve

as

a

proxy

for

what

biologically

derived

 natural

product

molecules

are

the

outcome

of

evolution

and

selection

given

these

same

 constraints. Fig. 5 shows that, as expected, for both databases, both the mean and variance of

 Bertz and Böttcher scores generally increase as NB increases. However, Bertz scores tend to be

 higher

for

PubChem

molecules

compared

to

COCONUT

2.0

molecules

of

the

same

size,

 whereas Böttcher scores show the opposite trend. MA expectedly show the sublinear trend seen

 earlier in Fig. 2d, and higher values are seen in PubChem molecules compared to same size

 COCONUT 2.0 molecules.

 Intriguingly, MA appears to distinguish between the databases starting from smaller 𝑁𝐵 values:

 for example, at 𝑁𝐵 = 20, MA separates the databases such that the mean of one coincides with

 the standard deviation of the other (Fig. 5c). This is not seen in the cases of Bertz and Böttcher,

 17







 where the means and standard deviations are not readily differentiable between the databases

 (Fig. 5a,b). This pattern remains even when we subset the databases to only consider molecules

 that strictly only contain carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen (Supplementary Fig. 11), and

 it

remains

(albeit

in

a

reduced

manner)

when

we examine

the

inverse

set

of

molecules

(i.e.

 those

that

contain

at

least

one

atom

that

is

not

carbon,

hydrogen,

nitrogen,

and

oxygen)

 (Supplementary Fig. 12). Altogether, this suggests that MA may detect differences between

 biological and non-biological origin starting from smaller sized molecules. We also examined

 the upper-bound of MA across both databases, and found that, for each 𝑁𝐵 value, the largest

 MA

from

PubChem

was

greater

than

or

equal

to

the

largest

MA

from

COCONUT

2.0

 (Supplementary Fig. 13)44,50. The largest 𝑁𝐵 value that maintained the strict upper-bound of

 𝑀𝐴 = 𝑁𝐵 − 1 occurred for 𝑁𝐵 = 14 in the COCONUT 2.0 database, and occurred much later,

 at 𝑁𝐵 = 24 in the PubChem database.

 Upon

inspecting

these

unusually

heterogenous

molecules,

we found that PubChem

contains

 pharmaceutical

compounds

that

require

synthetic

intervention,

thus

allowing

for

complex

 molecules to occur, even at relatively smaller molecular sizes. These PubChem molecules that

 contain large MA values (especially above any 𝑁𝐵-matched COCONUT 2.0 molecules) can

 potentially

be

studied

as

“molecular

technosignatures”,

i.e.

compounds

that

are

unlikely

to

 occur naturally without technological intervention51,52 (Supplementary Fig. 13). An additional

 reason we chose MA for this study was because algorithms like RecursiveMA can predict MA

 from MSn data, given that smaller peak masses of later stages add to form larger peak masses

 of earlier stages in recursive manners that parallel the joining operations of AT33. In contrast

 to

the

more

abstract

joining

operations

of

molecular

graph

correlates,

Böttcher

and

Bertz

 depend

heavily

on

explicitly

labeled

molecular

properties

(such

as

bond

types,

atom

types,

 valence

electrons,

stereocenters

and

their

configurations,

etc.)28,29,

and

thus

require

greater

 18





 structural elucidation than approaches based on features more interpretable from MS data, such

 as the additive properties of peak masses. As a result, as far as we know, it has not yet been

 shown whether an algorithm could successfully predict Böttcher and Bertz values directly from

 MS data (Table 2e).

databases had similar distribution of bond counts in their molecules.

 Altogether,

we

chose

MA

several

reasons:

it

appears

to

detect

underlying

structure

well,

it

 provides interpretable scalability, it has shown experimental promise as a life detection tool, it

 provides measurements for both individual molecules and ensembles of molecules, and it can

 be measured from MSn data (Table 2a-e). For future life detection missions using MSn, MA

 19









 scores can be calculated with the RecursiveMA algorithm. This

study explores whether ML

 can be used to predict MA scores for missions that rely on MS1 data.

 Limitations of algorithmic prediction of MA from MS1 data

 We

briefly

describe

the

RecursiveMA

algorithm

and

demonstrate

its

intended

uses

and

 limitations.

As

mentioned

earlier,

RecursiveMA

estimates

MA

from

MSn

data33.

It

 accomplishes this by setting an upper limit of MA estimation based on the parent mass as a

 first

order

approximation,

and

then

correcting

this

score

as

overlaps

in

child

fragments

are

 discovered33. In theory, complete information of all parent-child fragments in MSn data with

 infinite resolution should allow for the near-perfect measurement of MA. However, real-world

 MSn

data

provide

only

limited

fragmentation

information

(due

to

neutral

fragments,

 rearrangement

reactions,

limited

recursions,

loss

of

parent

masses,

and

different

bonds

 possessing different strengths). As a result, MA

values are predicted well, but not perfectly,

 when using RecursiveMA in real-world MSn data33.

 While some upcoming life detection missions in our Solar System will use MSn, many will use

 MS1 due to size and power constraints, the need for speed and efficiency, and the focus on in

 situ

analysis.

However,

RecursiveMA

is

not

designed

for

MS1

data,

as

such

data

does

not

 include the relationship between parent and fragment ion masses across stages. In some MS1

 data, parent ions are also lost, which further reduces the suitability of RecursiveMA33. This is

 especially

true

in

“hard” ionization

techniques,

such

as

electron

ionization (EI)

approaches,

 which

will

also

be

used

in

upcoming

life

detection

missions

in

our

Solar

System

 (Supplementary Fig. 15a). These limitations motivated us to create a ML model that can predict

 MA scores from MS1 data as a complementary approach to RecursiveMA that can predict MA

 scores from MSn data.

Simulated

data

provided fragment identification and allowed us to determine differences in m/z and intensity

of peaks based on collision energy. c, We obtained all molecules in the NIST SRD data that

contained both MS1 and an elucidated structure. The explanatory variable was the vectorized

MS1 data, where each vector index contained the peak intensity at the corresponding m/z value,

with intensities normalized between zero and unity. The response variable was the true MA

scores.

We

randomly

split

our

full

data

into

training

(70%)

and

testing

(30%)

data

using

a

stratified option that ensured equal distributions of true MA scores. We trained our XGBoost

model on the training data with an extensive hyperparameter grid search and selected the model

that minimized the relative MSE between the true and predicted MA scores of the testing data.

 21







 Evaluating ML prediction of MA from MS1 data

 We assessed whether ML could allow for MA prediction from MS1 data (Fig. 6a,c). For this,

 we trained an XGBoost36 model on all molecules with MS1 data on the NIST SRD database35,

 after removing a small subset of molecules that were unsuitable for analysis (Supplementary

 Fig. 1). We found that our model reduced the relative MSE by three-fold (from 0.12 to 0.04)

 as compared to the best-performing baseline model (Supplementary Table 2).



We observed that molecules with low MAs tended to be overpredicted and molecules with high

 MAs

tended

to

be

underpredicted

(Fig.

7).

The

molecules

with

low

MAs

were

likely

 overpredicted

due

to

the

strict

lower

bound

of

zero

for

possible

MA.

Importantly,

the

 underprediction

of

high

MA

molecules

ensured

that

our

model

remained

conservative,

 mitigating the risk of falsely categorizing molecules as stronger life indicators than they might

 truly represent. We also performed various quality checks and confirmed that our XGBoost

 model demonstrated the ideal learning curve (Supplementary Fig. 14), implying that our model

 was neither under- nor over-fitting to the training data. Next, we evaluated whether our well-

performing XGBoost model, trained on the

NIST SRD database35, could generalize to other

 datasets. For this, we obtained all EI-B MS1 data from the MassBank repository53 and removed

 any

molecules

that

had

already

been

trained

in

the

NIST

SRD

database.

Then,

we

ran

our

 XGBoost model from the NIST SRD data on the MassBank EI-B MS1 molecules, resulting in

 a relative MSE of 0.07. This still demonstrated an improvement over the best power law model

 fitted on molecular weight (0.12) (Supplementary Table 2). We noticed that MassBank allows

 users to fill out more than 100 metadata fields for their uploaded samples, with many fields

 encompassing

spectral information, such as instrument type, run time, and collision energy.

 While our XGBoost model confirmed that ML can predict MA reasonably well from MS, we

 22







 wished

to

investigate

how

these

MS

instrumental

parameters

affect

the

accuracy

of

this

 approach. In the next section, we investigate this question in detail by using simulated MS data.

 Fig. 7: XGBoost model performance on the NIST SRD data. a, Count of molecules per MA

bin for the training and testing data, b, absolute relative error (calculated as |𝑦 − 𝑦̂|/𝑦), and c,

signed

relative

error

(calculated

as (𝑦 − 𝑦̂)/𝑦)),

where 𝑦 equals

the

true

MA

score

and 𝑦̂

equals

the

predicted

MA

score.

Comparing

a

and

b,

we

see

an

anti-correlation

between

the

absolute relative errors and the count of molecules for each MA score in the data. As c shows,

low MA molecules tended to be over-predicted (leading to a negative signed prediction error)

and high MA molecules tended to be under-predicted (leading to a positive signed prediction

error).

This

trend

revealed

that

our

model

was

conservative

in

mitigating

false

positive

assignment

of

life

detection

(i.e.

was

unlikely

to

overestimate

the

MA

scores

of

high

MA

molecules).

 Determining instrument effects on ML error using simulated MS

 We generated theoretical MS data for the same molecules from the NIST SRD database using

 the Competitive Fragment Modeling IDentification (CFM-ID) version 4 software54. For each

 molecule, we generated three Electrospray Ionization (ESI) Quadrupole Time of Flight (QToF)

(MS/MS)

data,

(10eV),

(20eV),

and

 23









 energy

levels.

The

CFM-ID

software

was

able

to

produce

spectra

for

all

the

NIST

SRD

 molecules used in our main study, except for fourteen molecules, which we therefore excluded.

 We trained three XGBoost models (one for each energy level) with the same approach we used

 for the experimental NIST SRD dataset (Table 4, Fig. 6). Compared to the experimental data,

 the simulated data further reduced the relative MSE to values of 0.033 (for the 10eV-only data),

 0.031 (for the 20eV-only data), and 0.031 (for the 40eV-only data), yielding a four-fold (0.12

 to

0.03)

reduction

in

our

error

metric

compared

to

the

best-performing

baseline

model

 (diagonal cells in Table 4, Supplementary Table 2). It is likely that simulated MS data mitigates

 the inherent noise in experimental data, enhancing the predictability of MA scores, although it

 is not entirely a fair comparison as these two datasets had other differences (the NIST SRD

 data was MS1 that used EI, whereas the CFM-ID data was MSn that used ESI).

 We also trained an XGBoost model on split-energy data, where one-third of the MS data was

 from each of the three energy levels respectively. Our split-energy model resulted in a relative

 MSE of 0.035, which was larger than any of the single-energy models (diagonal cells in Table

 4). These results verified a decrease in the accurate prediction of MA when the data used non-

consistent

instrument

parameters.

These

observations

were

expected

as

we

had

already

 confirmed that different energy levels capture different information about the MS fragments

 (Fig. 6d, Supplementary Figs. 15-17).



If it is straightforward to measure MA with MS, then it would hypothetically be more powerful

 to

combine

information

across

various

energy

levels

to

simultaneously

capture

as

many

 different

subsets

of

MS

fragments.

To

investigate

this,

we

trained

an

XGBoost

model

on

 integrated-energy data, where each sample contained concatenated spectral data from all three

 energy levels (10eV, 20eV, and 40eV), providing a combined representation. As expected, our

 integrated-energy model performed the best of the five models, achieving the lowest relative

 24







 MSE of 0.029 (diagonal cells in Table 4, Supplementary Fig. 18). The XGBoost model trained

 on each of our five models

(diagonal cells in Table 4)

was then evaluated with the test sets

 from the other four models (non-diagonal cells in Table 4). For each XGBoost model trained

 on a single-energy level, the relative MSE increased when the testing set came from one of the

 other two energy levels or the mixed-energy level, with an almost doubling of error when the

 model trained on the 40eV data was tested on the 10eV data (0.031 to 0.060) (Table 4). For our

 XGBoost

model

trained

on

the

integrated-energy

level,

we

observed

a

more

than

2.3-fold

 increase

in

error

when

tested

on

the

10eV

data

(0.029

to

0.067)

(Table

4).

These

findings

 highlight the importance of consistent instrumental parameters between the training and testing

 data for optimal prediction of MA from MS datasets.



Even though our model performs much better than baseline models, we conducted several post-

hoc analyses to determine the underlying causes of over- and under-prediction of MA in our

 XGBoost models (see Supplementary Materials Section 4). We found that heavier molecules

 that

break

into

an

unusually

large

number

of

fragments

(such

as

molecules

with

long

 hydrocarbon chains) tend to increase the chance of an overprediction, while heavier molecules

 that do not break at all or only break into an unusually small number of fragments (such as

 molecules

with

fused

benzene

rings

and

steric

hindrance)

tend

to

increase

the

chance

of

an

 underprediction

(Supplementary

Figs.

19-21).

In

fact,

some

of

the

molecules

that

were

 unusually

underpredicted

in

our

model

simply

flew

through

the

MS

instrument

without

 breaking into any fragments at all, resulting in only a single peak (Supplementary Fig. 21).

 Hence, it seems that our XGBoost model itself does a suitable job with learning how to predict

 MA

scores

from

MS

data,

as

corroborated

by

our

smooth

and

convergent

learning

curves

 (Supplementary Fig. 14). Instead, the current limitations are not so much due to the model itself,

 25







 but

due

to

MS

instrumentation

constraints.

Given

that

our

model

performed

best

with

the

 integrated-energy

data

in

Table

4,

we

believe

it

is

likely

that

multimodal

approaches

could

 improve our model even further. For example, a multimodal model that incorporated MS data

 from energy levels even harsher than 40eV could potentially allow for the fragmentation of

 molecules

that

are

otherwise

too

stubborn

to

break

at

all

in

lower

energy

levels,

decreasing

 their

tendency

for

underprediction

(Supplementary

Fig.

21).

Altogether,

it

is

likely

our

 XGBoost model would effectively learn and benefit from such multi-modal MS information.



Conclusions

 In this work, we presented a proof-of-concept demonstrating the potential use of ML to predict

 molecular complexity as a biosignature from in situ mass spectrometers during future space

 missions. Although the application of ML in life detection remains a nascent endeavor, it holds

 significant promise55. Our work builds upon recent advancements in the field, complementing

 ongoing

efforts

that

underscore

the

growing

utility

of

ML

in

the

search

for

alien

life56,57.

 Additionally,

we

used

simulated

data

to

highlight

how

instrumental

parameters

in

MS

can

 influence fingerprint reproducibility, potentially diminishing the effectiveness of training sets.

 Our

study

emphasizes

the

need

for

well-standardized,

well-documented

MS

databases

to

 optimize their use in ML applications.



Our proof-of-concept considered the MA values of individual molecules. Implementation of

 this

metrology

on

other

planets

would

require

chromatographic

separation

of

individual

 molecules before fragmentation in the mass spectrometer. Nonetheless, it could be of interest

 to

conduct

a

similar

proof-of-concept

that

considers

the

JMA

indexes

of

ensembles

of

 molecules.

In

future

studies,

it

may

also

be

valuable

to

infer

MA

from

nuclear

magnetic

 resonance (NMR) data using ML33. If it is true that NMR approaches involve less variability

 26









 in instrumental parameters compared to MS58, then this could lead to better standardized data

 and, consequently, improved model performance. Although NMR is less likely to be deployed

 in upcoming space missions due to its size, weight, and power consumption, such a project

 could still provide meaningful insights. For example, it could be useful for predicting MA as a

 biosignature

in

extraterrestrial

samples

deliberately

returned

to Earth59,

or

in

extraterrestrial

 samples that arrive naturally on Earth, such as the ALH84001 meteorite60. Inferring MA from

 infrared (IR) data using ML is another area of interest, especially in the case of investigating

 biosignatures

in

exoplanetary

atmospheres.

In

some

scenarios,

it

could

be

worthwhile

to

 employ multimodal approaches that combine information from MS, NMR, and/or IR data to

 further improve the predictive power of molecular complexity when structural elucidation is

 difficult or impossible33,61.
