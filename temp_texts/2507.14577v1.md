# Abstract

 The hierarchical triple-helix structure of collagen type I (Col

I) is essential for extracellular

 matrix support and integrity. However, current reconstruction strategies face challenges such as

 chain

mismatch,

preventing

proper

fibril

formation.

Here,

we

report

a

supramolecular

co-

assembly strategy using a de novo–designed α-helical peptide amphiphile (APA) of just seven

 amino acids. The APA features a hydrophobic palmitic acid tail, which stabilizes the helical

 structure and promotes co-assembly upon interaction with complementary molecular structures.

 This minimal design enables selective recognition of fragmented collagen (FC), restoring triple-

helix conformation and guiding fibril formation. We applied this mechanism to engineer FC-

rich

nanofat

(NF)

into

a

mechanically

reinforced

biomaterial.

Integration

of APA-NF

with

 coaxial 3D printing enabled spatial control of structure and function. In a porcine model, this

 platform enhanced in situ vascularized adipose tissue regeneration. Our results demonstrate that

 hierarchical reconstruction of

collagen

via peptide-guided

supramolecular

assembly

offers

a

 promising strategy for soft tissue repair.

# Introduction

 Extracellular matrix (ECM) regulates fundamental cellular processes1,2, providing mechanical

support3 and facilitating biological signaling4–6 by mediating dynamic cell-ECM interactions

through mechanotransduction7,8. Collagen type I (Col I), the most abundant ECM protein, is

essential

for

maintaining

tissue

structural

integrity9

and

mechanics10.

These

functions

are

governed by its triple-helix structure11, composed of three parallel α-polypeptide chains. These

chains twist around a central axis to form superhelix molecules, which subsequently organize

into

fibrils

with

high

axial

alignment12,13.

The

critical

role

of

Col

I

has

inspired

extensive

biomimetic research. The Chaikof group14 and Xu group15 have each designed repeated modular

collagen-like peptides sequences to synthesize typical D-periodic banded fibrils. Collagen-like

trimers as short peptides can replicate the triple-helix motif but have struggled to organize into

parallel

fibrillar

structures16–19.

Thus,

these

approaches

are

limited

by

the

inability

to

fully

reproduce the atypical triple-helix structure of Col I, complicating efforts to recreate its native

architecture20.

 The

triple-helix

structure

is

stabilized

by

side-chain

hydrogen

bonding,

which

mediates

the

specific

folding

and

alignment

of

three

α-chains21.

The

resulting

Col

I

monomers

undergo

hierarchical alignment and bundle into fibrils and subsequently fascicles via hydrophobic and

electrostatic interactions12. This hierarchical fibrillar structure is highly resilient but difficult to

repair

after

mechanical

disruption13,22.The

Yu

group

has

developed

collagen

hybridizing

peptides (CHPs) based on POG repeats, which exhibit strong triple-helical propensity23, but

require

thermal

pretreatment

to

prevent

self-aggregation24.

Peptoids

reported

by

the

Feng

group25 have been employed to inhibit the CHP self-trimerization and enhance thermal stability,

but

this

intervention

has

slowed

the

folding

rate26.

Recently,

the

Raines

group

synthesized

covalently-tethered

parallel

CHP

strands

(dimeric

CHPs)

to

target

individual

denatured



 collagen chains26–28, but these often result in mismatches29,30. Moreover, due to their tendency

to self-trimerize, their primary role is to target denatured Col I, rather than to mimic native Col

I26.

Consequently,

CHP-remodeled

Col

I

lacks

the

intrinsic

driving

force

necessary

for

subsequent

assembly

into

fibrils

following

hybridization31,32.

Therefore,

the

challenge

in

repairing

the

triple-helix

structure

of

fragmented

Col

I

(FC)

lies

in

ensuring

specific

non- covalent interactions and achieving hierarchical self-assembly.

 the

programmed,

spontaneous

Multicomponent

self-assembly

(co-assembly)

enables

architectures

through

non-covalent

interactions33–36. Our previous work has demonstrated co-assembly yielding distinct structural

features

such

as

membranes37–39

and

gel40.

Extensive

research

has

been

conducted

on

controlling the co-assembly of short peptide amphiphiles (PAs) into well-defined hierarchical

structures40–42

such

as fibrils43–45,

ribbons46,47,

and lamellas48,49.

Most

existing

co-assembling

systems rely on β-sheet motifs to drive ordered molecular alignment50–52. In contrast, α-helix- based

self-assembly

systems

are

rare,

as

stabilizing

the

α-helical

conformation

demands

numerous intra-strand hydrogen bonds. Long peptide sequences (exceeding 21 amino acids53,54)

offer

more

hydrogen

bonding

opportunities

but

are

prone

to

nonspecific

interactions

and

misfolding.

Conversely,

shorter

sequences

(single

heptad

repeat

module)

ensure

precise

molecular interactions but suffer from conformational instability55. To address this, conjugating

a hydrophobic block to a short peptide

may promote and stabilize a well-defined secondary

structure

intrinsic

to

the

peptide

itself56,57.

Hydrophobic

domain

interactions

drive

the

self- assembly of PAs into highly ordered structures by inducing aggregation through hydrophobic

collapse, thereby increasing the local concentration of conjugated peptide segments. Compared

with traditional biosynthetic or mimetic approaches, co-assembly offers a promising strategy

for reconstructing the complex hierarchical organization of Col I, spanning from triple-helical

nanostructure to aligned fibrillar microstructure.

 Nanofat (NF), obtained through mechanical emulsification of adipose tissue, is rich in FC. It

contains cells, cytokines, and other bioactive components, granting it inherent advantages such

as

immune

compatibility

and

broad

availability58.

Owing

to

its

high

bioactivity

and

compatibility, NF has been successfully applied in scar repair, facial rejuvenation, and other

regenerative fields59. However, NF lacks volumetric support across applications60 due to the

disrupted Col I network within its ECM, compromising its mechanical strength61. Researchers

have attempted to enhance the mechanical property of NF by physically incorporating materials

with

greater

stiffness,

such

as

ceramic

particles62,63

and

hyaluronic

acid64,

but

leading

to

displacement and immune rejection due to poor localization. More critically, these materials

fail to replicate the dynamic mechanical adaptability of native ECM. Therefore, NF may serves

as an ideal autologous biomaterial for evaluating Col I repair strategies65 and advancing soft

tissue regeneration.

 Here, we report on an innovative PAs based on short sequence of α-helix peptide with only 7

amino acids (AA) and a hydrophobic palmitic acid (Pal) tail. The unconjugated 7AA peptide

adopts a random coil conformation, while conjugation with Pal induced α-helical folding. First,

we employed collagenases to develop an enzymatically FC model and validated the targeted

repair

of

Col

I

mediated

by

the

α-helical

peptide

amphiphile

(APA).

Experimental

analyses

confirmed that the APA could repair Col I fibers by restoring their characteristic triple-helical

 structure,

the

mechanism

was

elucidated

by

coarse-grained

molecular

(CGMD)

computer

simulations.

Second,

we

engineered

NF

into

a

bioactive

material

with

remodeled

structure

and

enhanced

mechanical

properties

through

co-assembling

with

APA,

which

effectively

repaired

the

disrupted

Col

I

network

within

NF

and

augmented

its

bioactivity.

Finally, we integrated the APA-NF system with coaxial 3D printing to fabricate hierarchical

bio-scaffolds. In vivo studies using nude mice and porcine models demonstrated successful in

situ remodelling of Col I and regeneration of vascularized adipose tissue. We illustrated the

innovative

co-assembly

mechanism

and

application

of

APA-FC/NF

system,

which

demonstrated the possibility to design functional self-assembling PAs based on α-helix.

 Results

 1.System rationale and materials designing

 APA was designed comprise of a hydrophilic short peptide and a hydrophobic tail (Fig. 1a).

 Hydrophilic short peptide AE (AEKIRKE) was chosen to repair the FC, which was reported to

 present a α-helix structure66,67 within a protein (Fig. 1a). However, the organization of seven

 residue

peptide

into

a

three-dimensional

(3D)

helical

fold

was

thermodynamically

 unfavourable53,68. To address this, a hydrophobic Pal tail was conjugated to the N-terminal of

 AE as APA (Pal-AEKIRKE) because Pal has been proved to increase the triple helix folding

 stability57,69,70 (Fig. 1a, b). To further validate the triple-helical sequence following the structural

 insights, we designed PAK (Pal-AEKIREK) and PAR (Pal-AEKIKRE) as controls (Fig. 1b).

 The reposition of the last three AA disrupted the triple-helix structure, while preserved the total

 molecular charge and AA composition.



 The FC model was established using collagenase to mimic the structural degradation of Col I

 (Fig. 1c). FC was individually co-assembled with four PAs sequences into nano- and micro-

structures

to

assess

their

capacity

to

repair

FC

toward

original

Col

I.

APA

was

found

to

 successfully co-assemble FC into hydrogel with triple-helix featured structure. Then, NF with

 an

abundance

of

FC

was

co-assembled

with

APA

into

hydrogel

with

robust

mechanical

 properties by repairing the Col I network. With the synergistic effect of bioactive components

 in

NF,

we

rationalized

APA-NF

(AN)

gels

would

enable

adipose

regeneration

and

 vascularization (Fig. 1d). Furthermore, we integrated a coaxial nozzle with the APA-NF system

 to supramolecular biofabricate hierarchical scaffolds for

in vivo grafting. Finally, nude mice

 and porcine soft tissue defect models confirmed that the AN gel scaffolds with repaired Col I

 molecular structure promoted soft tissue regeneration in a physiological microenvironment.

 2.Underlying mechanism of APA-FC co-assembly system

 Establishing the fragmented FC model

 To elucidate APA guided reconstitution of Col I distinct triple-helical structure in co-assembling



 processes, we performed collagenolysis to destroy the structure of Col I using metalloproteinase

 (MMP). Fibrillar Col I was cleaved into characteristic fragments by MMP-165,71,72 and further

 untangled

from

triple-helical

structure into

single-strand

collagen

polypeptides by

MMP-973

 (Fig. 2a). We first demonstrated that the particle size of Col I was significantly reduced from

 173.9

±

16.0 nm into 81.6 ± 24.0 nm after collagenolysis process by Dynamic Light Scattering

 (DLS). Since MMP-9 unwinds the helical trimer into monomers without changing the length

 of molecule, there is no significant difference between the size of Col I molecules digested by

 MMP-1 alone (81.6 ± 24.0 nm) and by both MMP-1&MMP-9 (94.8 ± 13.4 nm). The native Col

 I displayed a typical triple-helix spectrum of a positive peak around 220 nm and a large negative

 one near 200 nm74,75 characterized by circular dichroism (CD, Fig 2b, solid grey line). FC lost

 the

typical

triple

helix

structure

after

degradation,

showed

a

red

shifting

of

the

negative

 ellipticity to 205 nm with a positive peak at approximately 193 nm, suggesting the presence of

 untangled

helical

molecules76

(Fig.

2b,

solid

blue

line).

The

FC

with

random

fibrils

was

 revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

 The native Col I fibrils were approximately 100 nm in diameter with well-defined transversely

 banded structure akin to the D-periodicity as reported15 in TEM images, the length and diameter

 of

FC

were

significantly

reduced

through

collagenolysis

with

absence

of

D-periodicity

 (Extended Data Fig. 1a). These reductions in diameter and length of Col I fibrils were further

 confirmed by SEM (Extended Data Fig. 1b). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that we

 have

successfully

recreated

a

model

of

FC

with

an

unraveled

triple-helical

structure

by

 collagenolysis using MMP.

 Supramolecular characterization of APA-FC co-assembly

 After recreating the FC, we used APA, AE, PAK, and PAR to co-assemble with FC and try to

 recreate

the

triple-helix

and

D-periodic

structure.

First,

we

determined

that

FC

carries

a

 negative charge, which was opposite to that of the APA and control PAs (Fig. 1b) measured by

 electrophoretic

light

scattering

(ELS).

Then,

the

particle

size

of APA

before

and

after

co-

assembly

with

FC

(Fig.

2c)

were

analysis

by

DLS.

In

both

collagenolysis

stages,

FC

co-

assembled

with APA

to

form

particles

of

approximately

3000

nm,

which

were

significantly

 larger

than

those

formed

with

other

control

PAs,

measuring

smaller

than

1500nm.

The

 formation of the largest co-assembled structures by FC and APA among all tested PAs suggests

 the strongest intermolecular interactions40,77 between FC and APA. We studied the secondary

 structure changes of FC before and after co-assembly using CD. APA exhibited a negative peak

 at around 202 nm, driving FC to display a blue shift of the negative ellipticity back to 200 nm,

 providing

evidence

for

the

regaining

of the

original triple-helical

structure

of

Col

I

(Fig.2b,

 dashed

grey

line).

By

comparison,

FC

displayed

a

further

red

shift

with

other

control

PAs

 (Extended Data Fig. 1c), which deviating from the characterized pattern of Col I. Therefore,

 these results confirm that APA reconstructs the triple-helix secondary structure of FC through

 co-assembly.



 Micro- and Nano- scales characterization of APA-FC co-assembling structures

 The co-assembling of APA-FC gave rise to hierarchical architectures spanning from micro- to

 nano-scale

features.

FC

was

able

to

co-assemble

with

APA

into

fibrillar

aggregates

at

 microscale in SEM observations with a pronounced increase in fibril diameter (Extended Data

 Fig. 1b). The features of fibril formation with APA were further visualized by TEM. The FC

 (MMP-1&9),

digested

into

single

chains,

co-assembled

with APA

to

form

fibrillar

bundles

 characterised by periodic bright and dark bands

(Extended Data Fig. 1a). The co-assembled

 nanostructure features of APA-FC were revealed by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). By

 fitting

with

the

flexible

cylinder

model,

APA

and

FC

were

characterized

as

cylindrical

 nanofibrils with 59-Å radius and 482-Å radius, respectively. After co-assembling, the resulting

 APA-FC nanostructure was interpreted as a core-shell cylindrical nanofibril with 604-Å radius,

 with

a

shell

of

75.5-Å

in

thickness

(Fig.

2d

and

Extended

Data

Fig.

2a). APA-FC

showed

 pronounced scattering at low-q, indicating a cylindrical nanofibril structure. Additionally, APA-

FC exhibited scattering at high-q region, which corresponds to aggregates with smooth surfaces,

 further validating the formation of uniform co-assembled structure (Extended Data Fig. 2b).

 Overall, these results demonstrate that APA can effectively co-assemble with FC and facilitate

 the formation of fibrillar bundles with D-periodicity at micro- and nano- scales.

 Intermolecular mechanism of APA-FC co-assembly

 To

further

elucidate

the

molecular

mechanism

underlying

the

experimentally

observed

 supramolecular co-assembly in APA-FC system, we performed CGMD simulations using the

 MARTINI forcefield. In designing the coarse-grained representation of FC, we adopted a 29

 AA Col I model78, in which each helical chain is composed of repeating Gly-Pro-Hyp sequences.

 FC

was

modelled

as

monomeric

one-quarter

and

three-quarter

fragments

of

this

sequence,

 reflecting the two-step collagenolysis by MMP-1 and MMP-9 used in experimental processing.

 Simulations showed that FC alone aggregated into a less well-defined globule (Extended Data

 Fig. 3). Upon the spatially and rotationally random introduction of APA into the system (Fig.

 2e,

left),

its

presence

actively

promotes

the

co-assembly

of

the

FC

into

elongated,

fibrillar

 structures (Fig. 2e, right and Supplementary Movie 1), which are analogous to Col I. These

 simulation results consistent with the co-assembled morphology observed by SEM (Fig. 2f). To

 elucidate the molecular basis underlying this structural difference, we examined the structure

 formation of APA-FC co-assembled unit. Simulations revealed that two FC chains intertwined

 with the AE segment to form a triple-helical structure, with the hydrophobic Pal core buried at

 its center (Fig. 2g, right). As part of a multiscale simulation strategy, we performed a smaller-

scale

all-atom

simulation

of

the

APA-FC

system

to

obtain

a

finer-grained

structural

 representation. Ramachandran plot revealed that the Φ and Ψ dihedral angles in this atomistic

 model (Fig. 2g, bottom) closely resemble those characteristic of Col I79. Both the coarse-grained

 and atomistic simulations support the formation of an adaptive supramolecular triple-helical

 domain within the co-assembled system, with APA functioning as a molecular template that

 organizes FC chains into triple-helix conformations and promotes long-range order reminiscent

 of native Col I fibrils.

 To further verify the co-assembling mechanism through spatial correlations between APA and

 FC, we analysed the radial distribution function (RDF) of APA-FC system (Fig.2h). The RDF

 profiles

between

FC, AE,

Pal,

and

MARTINI

water

(W)

revealed

that

FC

exhibited

strong

 spatial

associations

with

both

the

hydrophobic

Pal

and

hydrophilic

AE

domains

of

APA,

 indicating

intimate

molecular

contact.

The

RDF

also

indicated

that

Pal

localized

at

short

 distance from FC, with the hydrophilic AE and amphiphilic FC components facing the aqueous

 phase, consistent with hydrophobic core formation. This spatial organization facilitates growth

 along the fibril axis. Complementarily, the different structural morphology and comparison of

 structural

anisotropy

between

FC-only

and APA-FC

systems

were

shown

by

the

radius

of

 gyration (Rg) time-series analysis (Fig. 2i). The APA-FC system showed much smaller decrease

 in Rg over time than FC-only system, indicating that more mass remained distributed away

 from the central axis, suggesting that APA prevents the collapse of FC into globular aggregates

 and promotes directional co-assembly into collagen-like architectures. Further, both systems

 exhibited the same aggregation propensity (AP = 2.0)80,81, indicating that the difference in Rg

 is not due to a difference in the total degree of aggregation but rather to the shape of the self-

/co-assembling structure each system organized into. This molecular mechanism supports the

 experimentally observed co-assembly behaviour and elucidates the spatial organization of APA

 and FC that underlies triple-helix formation. This molecular arrangement not only stabilizes the

 helical core but also facilitates directional co-assembly, ultimately enabling fibril elongation.





 3. Characterization of the APA-NF co-assembly system

 Supramolecular characterization of APA-NF co-assembly

 After revealing the co-assembling mechanism of APA and FC, APA was utilised to reconnect

 the FC-rich network within NF. NF carried a negative charge as expected, which was opposite

 to that of APA identified by ELS (Fig. 3a and Extended Data Fig. 4b). The average molecular

 size of NF suspension increased significantly from ~252 nm to ~2000 nm after co-assembling

 with APA evidenced by DLS (Fig. 3b). We further investigated the secondary structure changes

 associated with APA-NF co-assembly using CD. NF exhibited a typical α-helix spectrum, with

 a positive peak at 192 nm and negative peaks at 222 nm and 208 nm, transitioned to a triple-

helical pattern upon co-assembly with APA (Extended Data Fig. 4c). Inspired by the set-up of

 supramolecular biofabrication through interfacial liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS)37,38,40.

 NF was directly injected into the APA water solution to fabricate the APA-NF (AN) gel, where

 interfacial co-assembly was triggered immediately upon contacting (Fig.1d and Supplementary

 Movie 2). During this process, the generated AN gel maintained the injection-defined geometry,

 allowing

precise

control

over

its

morphology

based

on

injection

speed

and

trajectory.

The

 resulting AN gel was able to be retrieved intact from the APA water solution and maintained its

 structural

integrity

under

compressive

force

applied

by

forceps

(Fig.

3c

and

Supplementary

 Movie 3). These results confirm APA enables co-assembling with NF into robust hydrogel as a

 printable system with high fidelity.



 Enhanced mechanical properties of AN gel after co-assembling

 The observed structural integrity of AN gel inspired further investigation into its mechanical

 properties, which are critical for bioprinting and soft tissue grafting. Accordingly, rheological

 testing

was

performed

on

both AN

gel

and

NF.

Both

materials

were

elastic-dominant,

with

 storage moduli (G′) consistently exceeding loss moduli (G′′) across 0.1-100 rad s-1, shown by

 frequency sweep measurements. AN gel exhibited markedly higher G′ values than NF at both

 low (1045.45 Pa vs. 158.91 Pa) and high frequencies (2414.94 Pa vs. 381.52 Pa), suggesting

 the superior mechanical robustness and stiffness of AN gel under-deformation condition (Fig.

 3d,

left).

Under

constant

shear

(1

s-1),

AN

gel

maintained

a

significantly

higher

viscosity

 (207.85 Pa s) than NF (31.06 Pa s) over time, reflecting its superior mechanical integrity and

 structural

cohesion

(Extended

Data

Fig.

5a,

top).

Both

materials

showed

a

crossover

point

 between G′ and G′′ near 100% strain under strain sweep from 0.1 to 100% strain at 1 rad s-1,

 indicating comparable yielding behaviour under mechanical loading (Extended Data Fig. 5a,

 bottom).

These

findings

demonstrate

that

mechanical

reinforcement

in AN

gel

is

achieved

 without

sacrificing

deformability,

ensuring

ease

of

extrusion.

Shear-thinning

behaviour

was

 observed in both materials, as shown by negative slopes in shear rate sweeps (0.01-100 s-1),

 which is essential for injection-based applications (Fig. 3d, middle). To evaluate self-recovery,

 a series of low (1%) and high (500%) strains cycles was applied to each material as the G' and

 G'' were measured. Both materials showed modulus inversion under high strain, indicating a

 transition

to

liquid-like

behaviour,

followed

by

rapid

recovery

under

low

strain.

AN

gel

 recovered 72% of its original G′ within 1 min, compared to 64% for NF (Fig. 3d, right). This

 rapid

recovery

is

essential for

maintaining

fidelity

of AN

gel

structure

after

printing. These

 results demonstrate that remodelling FC network within AN gel lead to substantial mechanical

 reinforcement and improved mechanical recovery, while preserving favourable shear-thinning

 behaviour essential for printing applications, and yielding a modulus of approximately 1.6 kPa

 similar to that of native adipose tissue82,83.

 Micro- and Nano- scale characterization of AN co-assembling gel

 To explore whether the enhanced mechanical properties of AN gel resulted from its hierarchical

 structure

formed

during

co-assembly,

structural

and

compositional

characterizations

were

 carried out at both micro- and nano-scales. First, aligned fibrillar bundles resembling native

 Col I fibrils were observed on AN gel, whereas NF showed disordered aggregates, as visualized

 by SEM (Fig. 3e). This indicates that the insertion process facilitates directional remodelling of

 FC within NF, which is critical for reconstructing a native ECM-like architecture. In order to

 assess the components and key cytokines within AN gel, the total protein concentration was

 measured using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay. As expected, the protein concentration in

 AN

gel

was

similar

to that

of

NF,

indicating

the co-assembly

process

preserved

the

protein

 components

of

NF

in

AN

gel

(Fig.

3f).

AN

gel

and

NF

exhibited

significantly

higher

 concentration than fat as the emulsion protocol condensed the protein components84. Then, the

 components

of

NF

and

AN

gel

were

analysed

quantitatively

by

sodium

dodecyl

sulfate-

polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot (WB). AN gel presented all

 bands representing

in APA

and

NF,

revealing

that

all

components

within APA and

NF

were

 incorporated

in AN

gel

(Fig.

3g).

This

approach

also

illustrated

that APA

successfully

co-

assembled

with

NF

at

very

low

concentrations

(0.5%),

and

full

co-assembling

reaction

 completed in just 5 minutes (Extended Data Fig. 5b). Notably, several certain key cytokines

 known positively regulate cell proliferation and vascularization85–89 appeared as darker bands

 in AN gel compared to NF in the WB analysis, suggesting that the co-assembling procedure

 condense

the

NF

phase

through

interfacial

diffusion-reaction90

(Fig.

3h).

In

conclusion,

co-

assembly of APA and NF rapidly rebuild the Col I fibrillar network and condense with bioactive

 components,

providing

both

structural

and

biochemical

potential

for

tissue

regenerative

 applications.

 4.Biological validation

 Aggregation of cellular components via co-assembly



 The successful co-assembly of AN gel with fibrillar matrix and endogenous active components

 highlighted its potential as a bioactive material for tissue regeneration. In addition to abundant

 cytokines, NF contains a high density of vascular stromal cells, notably adipose-derived stem

 cells (ADSCs)91. To investigate cellular organization during the co-assembly process, we first

 performed nuclear staining to visualize cell distribution within NF and AN gel. Fluorescence

 microscopy revealed that the cells were significantly aggregated into clusters within the AN gel,

 whereas

sparsely

dispersed

in

the

NF

(Fig.

4a),

suggesting

that

the

co-assembling

process

 promotes localized cellular congregation. This spatially favourable aggregation of cells inspired

 further evaluation of the biocompatibility and biological effects of AN gel.

 Biocompatibility of AN gel

 The

biocompatibility

of

AN

gel

was

first

assessed

the

potential

toxicity.

The

absence

of

 genotoxicity was confirmed by comet assay results, with the percentage of DNA in the comet

 tail for ADSCs co-cultured with NF or AN gel remaining below 5% (Fig. 4b), comparable to

 the

negative

control

(untreated

cells).

Subsequently,

we

validated

the

biocompatibility

and

 proliferative

effects

of

AN

gel

by

co-culturing

with

ADSCs

and

human

umbilical

vein

 endothelial cells (hUVECs) separately for 7 days, given their distinct roles in adipose tissue

 regeneration and angiogenesis92,93. The experiments were performed in parallel with cells co-

cultured with NF and an untreated control group (Extended Data Fig. 6a). The biocompatibility

 of AN gel was further supported by Live/Dead assays. Both ADSCs and hUVECs maintained

 morphology characteristic of metabolically active cells over culture period, with few dead cells

 observed

(Extended

Data

Fig.

6b).

Continuous

proliferation

in

both ADSCs

and

hUVECs

 across all groups were revealed by cytotoxicity assays. Notably, ADSCs exhibited significantly

 higher viability in the AN gel group at day 3 compared to both NF and control. At day 7, no

 statistical difference was observed between the AN gel and the NF groups for either cell type

 (Fig. 4c). These results demonstrate AN gel is non-genotoxic and can serve as a biocompatible

 material.

 Supporting adipogenesis and angiogenic sprouting in vitro

 The

demonstrated

biocompatibility

of

AN

gel

motivated

further

validation

of

cellular

 responsiveness to its bioactive components. Therefore, we further validated the effect of AN

 gel in inducing functional cellular activity. Adipogenic lineages differentiation in ADSCs is a

 key process in adipose tissue formation. The formation and fusion of lipid droplets during 21-

day adipogenic induction in ADSCs co-cultured with AN gel, NF, or blank control group were

 evaluated by BODIPY staining (Fig. 4d). Quantitatively analysis revealed that the AN gel group

 exhibited the highest accumulation of lipid droplets in both number (4356 cells per field) and

 area (21.38×104 μm2), compared to the NF group (2501 cells per field; 9.35×104 μm2) and blank

 control

group

(743

cells

per

field;

3.71×104

μm2)

(Fig.

4e).

Furthermore,

the

expression

of

 adipogenic

genes

involved

in

lipid

metabolism

(GLUT4,

Perilipin1,

LPL,

CEBPa,

and

 PPARγ)94 were markedly upregulated in the AN gel group relative to both NF and blank control,

 supporting the enhanced adipogenic potential of AN gel (Fig. 4f).



 To verify the ability of AN gel to enhance cell migration, the key to embryonic blood vessel

 formation95–98,

hUVECs

were

used

to

assess

the

response

preference

towards

active

 components in AN gel. HUVECs were seeded on a porous insert membrane with immersed in

 leaching solution of AN gel, NF, or untreated medium. The number of migrated hUVECs on

 the bottom of the membrane were independently measured after 24 hours. AN gel was the most

 effective group in promoting cells migration (610 cells per filed), compared to the NF group

 (510 cells per filed) and blank control group (417 cells per field) (Fig. 4g). After 3 days of co-

culture

with AN,

NF,

or

blank

control

group,

hUVECs

co-cultured

with AN

gel

exhibited

 significantly higher expression of genes (PLAUR, CXCR4, PFKFB, and APLN), which were

 associated

with

sprouting

behaviour

of

hUVECs99

(Fig.

4h).

Taken

together,

the

results

 demonstrate that the AN

gel

has the

potential to

direct

cells

behaviour related to

soft tissue

 regeneration and angiogenesis in vitro.



 5. Multi-scale supramolecular biofabrication via 3D printing



 Coaxial 3D printing enables micro-to-macro control

 We developed the techniques to guide multiscale co-assembly process with APA-NF system

 using

covalent

extrusion 3D

printer,

according

to the

co-assembly

method

and

the

previous

 rheological findings. NF was extruded through the inner core, continuously co-assembling with

 the APA water solution from the outer core during printing (Fig. 5a). A series of 3D structures

 with

increasing

complexity

was

printed

with APA-NF

system. A

4-layers

5×5

log

pile

that

 designed to have a length and width of 25 mm was successfully printed, which had 10 pores

 unobstructed and each layer had been precisely deposited. For the stable G′ after co-assembling,

 the collapse of structure and the deformation of the bottom layer was not observed. To increase

 complexity, G-code was manually written to print the letters “WHUH” and modified Hilbert

 Curve, which had continuous turning and folding in 5 mm, each curve was successfully printed

 with each turning was clearly visible (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Movie 4). The co-assembling

 process

reconstructs

aligned

fibrils

when

coaxially

printed

under

the

horizontal

direction

 guidance.

The

relation

between

the

edge

of

AN

gel

scaffolds

and

printing

direction

were

 observed by SEM. Images show that the fibrillar bundles were well organized in alignment with

 the

long

axis

of

the

printed

direction

(Fig.

5c). These

results

demonstrate

that

the APA-NF

 system achieves controlled multi-scale supramolecular biofabrication with coaxial 3D printer,

 enabling simultaneous precision in aligned fibrillar microstructure reconstruction and complex

 3D macrostructural fidelity.

 AN gel scaffold promoting vascular morphogenesis

 To evaluate the capacity of the AN gel scaffold to support cell adhesion and 3D growth through

 its

realigned

microarchitecture.

We

seeded

ADSCs

(membrane-labeled,

red)

and

hUVECs

 (autofluorescent, GFP) in equal proportions (107 mL-1) on AN gel scaffold to observe cell-cell

 and cell-scaffold dynamic interactions. Confocal images showed initial cell adhesion at 8 hours

 after seeding, with cells maintaining a round morphology and beginning to extend pseudopodia

 after 24 hours. Both ADSCs and hUVECs exhibited intercellular contact by day 3, particularly

 hUVECs, forming tube-like structures within AN gel. The number of viable cells increased with

 time, leading to the formation of a continuous tubular vascular-like structure by day 7 (Fig. 5d).

 The

morphology

of

the

cell

cluster

on

the

final

cell-scaffold

construct

was

visualized

using

 immunostaining

of

cell

surface

markers.

Images

reinforced

that

hUVECs

arranged

into

a

 vessel-mimicking lumen, shaped by the topological features of AN gel scaffold (Fig. 5e). These

 results demonstrate that, by taking advantage of supramolecular force driven Col I-like fibrils

 reconstruction and enhanced bioactivity of the APA-NF system, make it feasible to fabricate

 3D scaffolds that mimic native ECM in multiscale and promote cell growth.

 6. Evaluation of soft tissue regeneration in vivo

 Structural and morphological evaluation of grafted scaffolds

 We established a subcutaneous graft model in nude mice to evaluate the in vivo regeneration

 capacity

of

AN

gel.

To

assess

both

the

short-term

degradation

profile

and

the

long-term

 regenerative performance of AN gel scaffolds, we performed histological and morphological

 analyses at 4 and 12 weeks post-grafting. The in vivo status of the grafted scaffolds was assessed

 at both time points, revealing regenerative adipose tissue with subdermal vascular connection

 in the AN gel group, whereas the NF group exhibited structural fragmentation and increased oil

 cysts formation containing liquefied fat (Extended Data Fig. 7b). At both 4 and 12 weeks post-

grafting,

the

AN

gel

group

exhibited

significantly

greater

volume

retention

(57.73%

and

 42.20%, respectively) compared to the NF group (46.63% and 22.20%) (Extended Data Fig.

 7c). The AN

gel

group

preserved

structural

integrity

over

time,

maintaining

adipose

lobule

 architecture and minimizing vacuole formation, with portions of the 3D-printed spiral shape

 still visible at 4 weeks in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining images. In contrast, the NF

 group showed structural fragmentation and acellular cavities (Fig. 6a and Extended Data Fig.

 8). The

dense

and

organized

Col

I

was

deposited

in the AN

gel

group,

while

the

NF

group

 exhibited

progressive

disintegration

shown

by

Masson's

Trichrome

(Masson)

and

 Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining. In the AN gel group, collagen content increased from

 14.45% pre-grafting to 50.66% at 12 weeks post-grafting, while the NF group peaked at 14.07%

 at 4 weeks and declined to 12.85% at 12 weeks (Fig. 6b). Quantification of Col I-positive areas

 showed a similar trend at 4 and 12 weeks post-grafting, increased from 14.28% to 45.63% in

 the AN gel group, but declined from 12.87% to 12.16% in the NF group, despite similar baseline

 levels before grafting (Fig. 6b). These findings were further confirmed with aligned fibrillar

 structures and intact, spherical cells observed in AN gel scaffolds by SEM at 12 weeks (Fig. 6c,

 purple

arrows),

whereas

the

NF

group

showed

disorganized

fibrils

and

collapsed

cells

with

 irregular membranes (Fig. 6c, yellow arrow). These results validate the capability of AN gel to

 maintain

morphology

after

grafting

 in

vivo

while

providing

a

favourable

 tissue

 microenvironment

by

reconstructing

ECM

that

promotes

tissue

regeneration,

especially

for

 cells and Col I.



 Adipocyte maturation and vascularization of grafted scaffolds in vivo

 To demonstrate that the cells grown in the scaffolds were indeed adipocytes and their correlation

 with vascularization during the repair process, immunofluorescence (IF) staining for Perilipin

 (PLIN,

adipocyte

marker)

and

CD31

(endothelial

marker)

were

performed

(Fig.

6a

and

 Extended Data Fig. 8,9). PLIN-positive areas in the AN gel group increased from 1.26% pre-

grafting to 1.65% at 4 weeks post-grafting and 6.98% at 12 weeks post-grafting, while the NF

 group decreased from 1.25% to 0.04% and slightly increased to 0.84%. Consistently, CD31-

positive areas in the AN gel group rose from 0.51% to 0.95% and 1.31% at 4 and 12 weeks

 post-grafting, whereas the NF group declined from 0.52% to 0.16% and remained low at 0.18%.

 These results indicated that adipocytes progressively matured with a concomitant increase in

 adipocyte density over the 12 weeks post-grafting (Fig. 6b). We also observed blood vessels

 formed

by

endothelial

cells

surrounding

vacuolated

adipocytes

(Extended

Data

Fig.

8,9),

 establishing

pathways

for

nutrient

diffusion

for

adipose

tissue

regeneration.

These

findings

 confirm

that

AN

gel

promotes

sustained

adipocyte

development

in

parallel

with

vascular

 formation after grafting in vivo.



 Preclinical porcine soft tissue defect model to demonstrate the repair function of AN gel

 To further evaluate the efficacy of the AN gel in clinical application, we conducted a preclinical

 pilot study using a porcine model. This model aimed to address physiological and anatomical

 differences between small animals and humans, particularly related to size and inflammatory

 response. We

developed

a

soft

tissue

defect

porcine

model

by

surgically

removing

3 mm

×

 3 mm squares of 1 cm-thick subcutaneous adipose tissue from the lateral abdomen. The injured

 area underwent fibrotic repair leading to scar tissue healing after one-month of surgical wound

 stabilization. Conventional autologous filler materials macrofat (diameter >1 mm) and NF as

 control groups, because they were widely used in clinic. They were compared to the AN gel,

 and each filler was performed on the site of the soft tissue defects. The grafted site and adjacent

 intact soft tissue were collected at 6 months post-surgery, to characterize the architecture of

 dermis

and

subdermal

adipose

tissue.

Concurrently,

untreated

defective

site

tissues

were

 harvested as controls to characterize scar-mediated healing.



 Acute loss of subdermal adipose tissue triggered fibrotic remodelling, characterized in vivo by

 well-demarcated depression and dense fibrous deposition. While all treatment groups exhibited

 restoration in varying degrees, only the AN gel group demonstrated near-complete volumetric

 recovery with seamless tissue integration and indistinct boundaries between regenerated and

 native

regions

(Fig.

6d,

blue

overlays).

In

contrast,

macrofat

and

NF

treatments

resulted

in

 residual

depressions,

suggestive

of

limited

structural

remodelling.

AN

gel

grafting

fully

 restored

tissue

volume

and

supported

the

regeneration

of

large,

mature

adipocyte

clusters

 (Extended Data Fig. 10, blue arrows) throughout the subdermal layer, closely recapitulating

 native morphology, as shown by H&E staining. Importantly, the fibrotic tissue (Fig. 6d, green

 overlays) was replaced by a well-organized structure, as clearly revealed by Masson staining

 specific to fibrous tissue, suggesting that AN gel disrupted scar-dermis adhesions and facilitated

 hierarchical tissue remodelling during regeneration. Although partial adipose regeneration was

 observed in the macrofat and NF group, both failed to resolve persistent scar-dermis adhesions

 or re-establish native tissue architecture. The histological findings were further corroborated by

 evidence of effective scar remodelling in the AN gel group, as demonstrated by IHC staining

 for

Col

I

(Fig.

6d).

Together,

these

results

demonstrate

that

AN

gel

promotes

structural

 regeneration by replacing disorganized scar tissue with organized, layered regenerative tissue,

 achieving both volumetric restoration and functional integration beyond passive space-filling

 repair.



 Adipocyte morphology and vascular distribution differences in tissue regeneration

 We further looked into the in situ generation at cell level, regenerated adipocytes in the AN gel

 group

(Fig.

6d,

yellow

arrows)

exhibited

clear,

continuous

PLIN-positive

membranes

and

 distributed in lobular clusters in IF staining of PLIN (green), which were resembled with those

 in native adipose tissue (Fig. 6d, white arrows). In contrast, other groups showed sparse PLIN

 staining,

with

atrophic

adipocytes

and

disrupted

spatial

continuity,

indicating

incomplete

 adipose

tissue

regeneration.

Tissue

vascularization

and

significant

differences

in

vascular

 distribution

were

further

characterized.

The

AN

gel

group

exhibited

uniform

vascular

 distribution

resembling

native

tissue,

characterized

by

IF

staining

of

CD31

(Fig.

6d,

red).

 Notably,

a

high-density

vascular

network

(Fig.

6d,

yellow

asterisks)

was

observed

at

the

 dermal-fat

interface,

suggesting

active

angiogenic

support

for

regenerating

adipocytes.

In

 control,

macrofat,

and

NF

groups,

scar

tissue

regions

contained

densely

clustered

small-

diameter

blood

vessels,

while

sparse

vascularization

surrounding

adipocyte

clusters.

These

 results demonstrate that AN gel actively promotes coordinated regeneration of adipose tissue

 and vasculature, effectively recapitulates native organization compared to other treatments.

 Discussion

 In this study, we demonstrate the rational design of a functional APA capable of reconstructing

 the hierarchical triple-helix structure of Col I through supramolecular co-assembly with FC.

 Despite comprising only seven amino acids, APA exhibits a strong intrinsic α-helical folding

 propensity. The conjugated hydrophobic palmitic acid tail plays a pivotal role in stabilizing this

 conformation

and

promoting

supramolecular

assembly.

This

molecular

design

enabled

the

 remodelling of FC, significantly enhancing both the biological functionality and mechanical

 properties

of

NF,

as

validated

in

vitro

and

in

vivo.

Furthermore,

the

integration

of APA-NF

 system

with

coaxial

3D

printing

established

a

programmable

supramolecular

biofabrication

 platform.

Key

advantages

of

this

work

include:

(1)

de

novo

design

of

α-helical

PAs;

(2)

 hierarchical reconstruction via co-assembly; (3) functional translation into biomaterials; and (4)

 a clinically translatable fabrication strategy. Collectively, these findings represent a significant

 advance

in

supramolecular

design,

leveraging

native

self-assembly

mechanisms

to

engineer

 functional biomaterials for regenerative medicine.

 Methods

 Synthesis and characterization of PAs

 APA, AE, PAK, and PAR molecules were provided by GL biochem (China). The sequences and

 molecular weights of the PAs are shown in Figure 1a. PAs were synthesized via solid-phase

 and NMRPipe software100. The processed NMR spectra were visualized, assigned and analysed

 using POKY software101.

 Collagenolysis of Col I

 Purified rat tail collagen type I sterile solution (5 mg/mL in 20 mM acetic acid) was purchased

 from

Bio-Techne,

US.

Fibril

formation

was

induced

by

diluting

collagen

into

1X

PBS

and

 adjusting the pH to neutral with 1N NaOH. Final collagen concentration was 0.4 mg/mL, and

 the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. MMP1 and MMP9 (ACRO Biosystems, China)

 were

activated

using

1

mM

p-aminophenylmercuric

acetate

(APMA,

Sigma,

US)

in TCNB

 buffer (Sigma, US) at 50 μg/mL and 100 μg/mL, respectively, at 37 °C. Activated enzymes were

 diluted to 0.2 μg/mL (MMP1) and 1 μg/mL (MMP9) in TCNB buffer and incubated with Col I

 at 37 °C overnight.

 Dynamic light scattering (DLS)

 Particle

size

distributions

of

Col

I

and

FC

were

measured

using

a

Nanolink

instrument

 (linkoptik, China). Samples were diluted to 0.05 wt% with distilled water prior to analysis.



 Circular dichroism (CD)

 Solutions of Col I and FC (0.05 wt%) were transferred into 0.01 mm cuvettes and

analysed

 using a CD spectrometer (JASCO, Japan). Spectra were collected by averaging 10 scans over

 the 190-260 nm range at a scan rate of 50 nm/min. Data were smoothed using a simple moving

 average method.

 Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)

 Col

I

and

FC

solutions

were

deposited

onto

200-mesh

carbon-coated TEM

grids

for

5

min,

 followed by staining with 2 wt% uranyl acetate for 30 s. Grids were rinsed with ultrapure water

 for 30 s and air-dried at room temperature for 24 h. Bright-field imaging was performed on an

 HT7800 TEM (HITACHI, Japan) operating at 80 kV.

 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)

 Samples of Col I and FC were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Servicebio, China) for

 10

min

and

dehydrated

using

an

ethanol

gradient

(70%,

80%,

90%,

96%,

100%)

at

room

 temperature. Dried samples were coated with gold after critical point drying (HARVENT, China)

 and imaged using GeminiSEM 300 (ZEISS, Germany).

 Electrophoretic light scattering (ELS)

 Zeta potentials of Col I (0.05 wt%) and PAs (0.01%) solutions were measured at 25 °C using a

 NanoLink zeta potential analyzer (linkoptik, China). Samples were prepared in ultrapure water

 and equilibrated for 10 min at the measurement temperature.

 Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS)

 D2O was added to an equal volume of FC solution. The PAs were dissolved in D2O at 2 wt%,

 and the FC (50% D2O/50% H2O)-PAs (2 wt%) mixed solution was prepared for measurement.

 Measurements

were

performed

using

the

SANS

instrument

(The

BL01

at

China

Spallation

 Neutron Source, China). Solutions (1 mL) of individual components were loaded into 1-mm-

path-length hellma quartz cuvettes, while the mixture was prepared in a demountable 1-mm-

path-length cuvette. Cuvettes were mounted in aluminum holders within a sealed, computer-

controlled sample chamber maintained at 25 °C. Each measurement took approximately 30 min.

 All

scattering

were

normalized

to

sample

transmission,

background

was

 performed

using

a

quartz

cell

filled

with

D2O,

and

linearity

and

were

 corrected using the instrument-specific software. The incident neutrons with wavelength of 1.1-

9.8 Å were defined by a double-disc bandwidth chopper, which is collimated to the sample by

 a pair of apertures. The experiment used the sample to detector distance of 5 m and a sample

 aperture of 8 mm in diameter. The two dimensional 3He tubes array detector allows to cover a

 wide Q range from 0.004 Å-1 to 0.7 Å-1. We collected approximate 60 min scattering information

 for each sample, including the empty sample holder and sample cell. The scattering data were

 set to absolute unit after normalization, transmission correction and standard sample calibration.

 Molecular Dynamics Simulations

 Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations were performed using the MARTINI

NVT,

NPT

with

Berendsen

The

LINCS

 algorithm110,111



was applied to constrain all hydrogen atom bonds, enabling an increase in the

 timestep from 1 fs to 2 fs. The entire simulation was conducted over a total duration of 100 ns.

 To expedite the interactions between APA and FC, a weak flat-bottom restraint was introduced

 between one of the APA monomers and the other monomers. Particle Mesh Ewald112 was used

 to evaluate electrostatic interactions throughout the atomistic simulation.

 Sample preparation (NF)

 Adipose tissue was obtained from abdominoplasty patients with informed consent and ethics

 approval (Huazhong University of Science and Technology, [2019] IEC (S864)). After mincing,

 samples were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 3 min. NF was prepared by emulsifying the tissue

 between two 10-mL syringes connected with Luer Lock connectors (Tulip, US) of decreasing

 diameters (1.2 mm, 1.0 mm, 0.8 mm).

 Sample preparation (APA-NF gel)

 APA was dissolved in deionized water to a final concentration of 2 wt%. An equal volume of

 NF solution was slowly injected into the APA solution at a constant rate without stirring. The

 mixture

was

then

left

undisturbed

at

4 °C

for

1

hour

to

allow

complete

gel

formation.

The

 resulting APA-NF gel was collected for subsequent use.

 Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay

 Fat tissue was minced and homogenized to obtain fat homogenates. For fat, NF, and AN gel

 samples, RIPA lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) with PMSF (Aladdin, China) was

 added at 250 μL per 20 mg sample. After lysis on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g

 for 5 min, and supernatants collected. Protein levels were quantified using the BCA Protein

 Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). Diluted BSA standards and samples were added to

 a 96-well plate with BCA working reagent (sample to working reagent ratio = 1:8), incubated

 at

37 °C

for

30

min,

and

absorbance

measured

at

540-590 nm.

Protein

concentrations

were

 calculated based on the standard curve.

 Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)

 For SDS-PAGE, AN gel was prepared under two experimental designs: (1) fixed reaction time

 of 1 h with APA at concentrations of 2.0%, 1.5%, 1.0%, 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.05%, and 0.01%; (2)

 fixed APA concentration of 1% with reaction times of 5, 10, 30, and 60 min. After gelation,

 residual APA was blotted off. Gels were disrupted by pipetting and vortexing, then diluted 10-

fold in PBS. Samples (15 μL of fat, NF, AN, and APA solution) were mixed with 5 μL of loading

 buffer (Sigma, US), heated at 90 °C for 5 min, and loaded into pre-cast NuPAGE Bis-Tris gels

 (ACE Biotechnology, China). A 5 μL pre-stained protein ladder (10-180 kDa, Thermo Fisher

 Scientific, US) was included. Electrophoresis was conducted for 1 h at 120 V using NuPAGE

 MES SDS buffer, followed by Coomassie brilliant blue staining (Beyotime, China) and imaging

 with a gel documentation system (BLT-IMAGING, China).

 chemiluminescence system.

 Rheological test

 Rheological measurements were performed on a Discovery Hybrid Rheometer (TA Instruments,

 US) using a 20 mm parallel plate. A total of 500 μL of NF or AN gel was deposited onto the

 stage, and the top plate was lowered to a 1000 μm gap. Excess material was removed. The tests

 included: frequency sweep (0.1-100 rad s⁻¹ at 1% strain), time sweep (at a constant shear rate

 of 1 s⁻¹), strain sweep (0.1-100% strain at 1 rad s⁻¹), shear rate sweep (0.01-100 s⁻¹), and shear

 recovery (a minute cycles each at high (500%), low (1%) strain at 1 rad s−1).

 Isolation and culture of ADSCs

 Complete ADSC

culture

medium

consisted

of

L-DMEM

(Gibco,

US), 10%

FBS

(HyClone,

 US), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PS, Gibco, US). Adipose tissue was washed with sterile

 PBS and digested with 0.2% collagenase NB-4 (Nordmark, Germany) in complete medium at

 37 °C

for

4

h. After

digestion,

the

tissue

was

centrifuged

at

1500

rpm

for

5

min.

The

cell

 suspension was filtered and seeded into culture dishes. Non-adherent cells were removed on

 day 3 by medium exchange. Cells at 80-90% confluence were passaged using trypsin/EDTA

 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). ADSCs from passages 3-5 were used for all experiments.

 DAPI staining

 To visualize the spatial distribution of cells in NF and AN gel, samples were fixed in 4% PFA



 for 20 min at room temperature, followed by three PBS washes. Fixed samples were stained

 with DAPI (Beyotime, China) and incubated at room temperature before imaging by confocal

 microscopy (Nikon, Japan).

 Comet assay

 ADSCs were co-cultured with either NF or AN gel for 1 week. Untreated cells were used as

 negative

controls;

cells

treated

with

25

µM

potassium

permanganate

for

20

min

served

as

 positive

controls.

Cells

were

dissociated

into

single-cell

suspensions,

adjusted

to

1

×

10⁵

 cells/mL, mixed with 1% low-gelling-temperature agarose at 37 °C (1:6 v/v), and loaded onto

 agarose-coated slides. Slides were immersed in lysis buffer (Bio-Techne, US) for 1 h at 4 °C,

 then washed with PBS for 30 min twice at room temperature. Slides were placed in rinse buffer

 and subjected to electrophoresis at 20 V (0.6 V/cm) for 30 min. After neutralization in distilled

 water, slides were stained with 1.0 µg/mL ethidium bromide (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) for

 20 min. All images were performed using confocal microscopy and analysed with ImageJ.

 Cell viability and cytotoxicity testing

 hUVECs

were

obtained

from

Procell

(China)

and

cultured

in

RPMI

medium

(Gibco,

US)

 supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco, US) and 1% PS (Gibco, US). ADSCs or hUVECs were

 seeded on porous insert membranes with test materials placed on top and cultured for 7 days.

 Cell viability was assessed using Live/Dead Cell Double Staining Kit (Sigma, US) on days 1,

 3, and 7. A mixture of propidium iodide (PI) and Calcein AM in PBS was applied for 30 min at

 37 °C. Cells were visualized using a confocal microscope. Cytotoxicity was evaluated using a

 Cell Counting Kit 8 (Abcam, UK) following the manufacturer’s protocol, and absorbance was

 measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek, US).

 Adipogenic induction of ADSCs

 For adipogenic differentiation, ADSCs were treated with adipogenic induction medium (AIM),

 consisting of H-DMEM (Gibco, US), 10% FBS (HyClone, US), 1% PS (Gibco, US), 1

μM

 dexamethasone (Sigma, US), 200 μM indomethacin (Sigma, US), 10 μg/mL insulin (Sigma,

 US),

2

μM

rosiglitazone

(Sigma,

US)

and

0.5

mM

IBMX

(Sigma,

US).

To

maintain

 differentiation,

adipogenic maintenance

medium

(AMM)

was

composed

of

H-DMEM,

10%

 FBS,

1%

PS,

2%

L-glutamine,

and

10

μg/mL

insulin.

On

day

7

of

co-culture,

adipogenic

 induction was initiated by alternating AIM (3 days) and AMM (1 day).

 BODIPY and phalloidin staining:

 Cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 30 min at room temperature.

 They were then incubated with 2 μM BODIPY (MedChemExpress, US) in the dark for 30 min,

 followed

by

three

PBS

washes. Alexa

Fluor

594-phalloidin

(Thermo

Fisher

Scientific,

US)

 diluted in PBS was added and incubated in the dark for 60 min. Nuclei were counterstained

 with

DAPI

for

20

min.

Samples

were

washed

with

PBS

and

imaged

using

a

confocal

 microscope (Nikon, Japan).

 PCR

 ADSCs were co-cultured with NF or AN gel for 7 days for adipogenesis analysis, and hUVECs

 were co-cultured for 1 day to assess sprouting. Total RNA was extracted using TriQuick reagent

 (Solarbio, China) and stored at −80 °C. Reverse transcription was performed using 2.5 μg of

 RNA

with

a

SCILOGEX

SCI1000-G

system.

Quantitative

PCR

was

conducted

on

an ABI

 QuantStudio 1 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, US) using primers listed in

 Table S1. PCR cycling conditions were: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 45 cycles of 94 °C for 5

 s and 60 °C for 30 s. GAPDH was used as the housekeeping gene. Relative expression levels

 were determined using the ΔΔCt method and normalized to the control group.

 Chemotactic migration assay

 Chemotactic migration of hUVECs was assessed using a Transwell assay (8.0 μm pore size,

 Corning,

US).

HUVECs

were

seeded

at

a

density

of

5

×

10³

cells

per

insert

in

serum-free

 medium

and

incubated

for

24

hours

at

37°C.

The

lower

chambers

contained

leachate

 (experimental)

or

basal

medium

(control). After

24

hours,

non-migrated

cells

on

the

upper

 surface of the membrane were gently removed with a cotton swab. The membrane was then

 removed from the insert, and DAPI staining was performed to visualize migrated cells on the

 underside.

 APA-NF system coaxial printing

 A coaxial nozzle was used to extrude the APA-NF system, with NF as the core fluid (17G needle)

 and APA solution as the sheath fluid (13G needle). Printing paths were controlled via G-code

 and

executed

using

BioMaker V2

software

on

a

Bioprinter

(SunP

Biotech,

China).

Printing

 speed and extrusion rate were set to 5 mm/s and 5 mm³/s, respectively. APA solution was driven

 by a plunger at 50 mm/min.

 Cell seeding on scaffold

 For live-cell tracking, GFP-hUVECs (IMMOCELL, China) were used. ADSCs were labeled

 with the

membrane

dye

Dil

(red

fluorescence)

and

pseudocolored

in

magenta

during

image

 processing to distinguish from live/dead staining. AN gel scaffolds were printed into sterile 6-

well plates and pre-wetted with medium for 2 h. ADSCs and hUVECs were mixed 1:1 (final

 concentration: 1 × 10⁷ cells/mL) in a 1:1 blend of their complete media. Cell suspension was

 pipetted

onto

scaffolds

and

incubated

under

standard

conditions.

Cell

distribution

was

 visualized by confocal microscopy (Nikon, Japan).

 Immunofluorescence staining

 Scaffolds co-cultured with cells for 7 days were fixed with 4% PFA and processed for paraffin

 embedding. Sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and blocked with 3% BSA for 30 min at

 room

temperature.

Primary

antibodies

(Servicebio,

China)

against

CD29

(for ADSCs)

and

 CD31 (for hUVECs) were applied overnight at 4 °C. After washing, secondary fluorophore-

conjugated antibodies (Service, China) were added for 50 min at room temperature. DAPI was

 used for nuclear staining. Samples were visualized using a confocal microscope.

 Animal experiments (nude mice model)

 Animal

procedures

were

approved

by

the

Institutional Animal

Care

and

Use

Committee

of

 Huazhong University of Science and Technology ([2023] IACUC Number:4735). Nude mice

 were anesthetized with 30 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (Sigma, US). To evaluate this, spiral

 layer-by-layer 3D printed AN gel scaffold was subcutaneously grafted over the dorsum of the

 nude

mice. The

control

group

consisted

of

NF

scaffolds formed

by

replacing

the

outer-axis

 solution

with

sterile

saline

solution.

Each

scaffold

had

a

fixed

volume

of

0.25

mL,

with

 standardized

printing

parameters

minimizing

inter-sample

variability.

Prior

to

grafting,

the

 dorsal skin of nude mice was sterilized. Two small incisions (approximately 10 mm) were made

 on either side of the dorsal midline, followed by blunt dissection of the subcutaneous tissue

 beneath each incision to create independent subcutaneous pockets. Care was taken to ensure

 that the two pockets did not communicate, thereby preventing scaffold displacement or fusion.

 AN gel and NF scaffolds were then inserted into the respective subcutaneous cavities above the

 muscle.

The

incisions

were

closed

with

sutures. After

surgery,

the

mice

were

placed

in

an

 incubator until full recovery from anesthesia. Tissues were harvested at 4 and 12 weeks post-

grafting

(n

=

4

per

group)

following

euthanasia.

Histological

assessment

was

performed

by

 blinded observers.

 Histological staining

 Subcutaneously

grafts

were

harvested

and

fixed

in

4%

PFA

overnight

at

4 °C.

The

tissue

 specimen

was

sectioned

in

the

cross-sectional

or

longitudinal

direction

and

stained

with

 haematoxylin and eosin (Servicebio, China) and Masson’s trichrome (Servicebio, China). For

 Masson-stained images, collagen deposition was evaluated by calculating the collagen area (%)

 as

the

ratio

of

blue-stained

area

to

the

total

stained

area

in

randomly

selected

fields.

 Immunohistochemical

staining

for

Col

I

was

performed,

and

the

positive

area

of

Col

I

was

 quantified

based

on

the

stained

regions.

Immunofluorescence

staining

was

conducted

as

 described previously, targeting Perilipin (PLIN) and CD31. The percentage of PLIN-postive

 cells and CD31-positive cells was quantified in randomly selected regions. All image analysis

 was performed using ImageJ.

 Animal experiments (porcine model)

 Animal

procedures

were

approved

by

the

Committee

on Animal

Care

of

Hubei Yizhicheng

 Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Number WDRM-202401003). Female pigs weighing 30-35 kg were

 anesthetized

by

inhalation

of

isoflurane,

followed

by

endotracheal

intubation

to

maintain

 anesthesia. Throughout the procedure, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and blood

 oxygen saturation were continuously monitored. To establish soft tissue defects, animals were

 placed in a lateral recumbent position and secured. The lateral abdominal skin was disinfected

 thoroughly. A rectangular skin flap measuring 12 cm in length and 8 cm in width was created

 on the abdominal region, with the long edge serving as the pedicle. The flap was dissected at

 the level below the deep adipose layer to allow full mobilization. Four square defects (3 mm ×

 3 mm) were created within the flap, each dissected down to a depth of 1 cm beneath the dermis.

 All

defects

were

spatially

separated

to

prevent

intercommunication

and

ensure

independent

 wound

healing.

The

incisions

were

closed

and

the

flap

secured

using

the

tie-over

bolster

 technique

to

provide

compression

and

prevent

the

formation

of

subcutaneous

dead

space.

 Postoperatively, animals received antibiotic prophylaxis for 3 days to prevent infection.

 One month after the initial surgery, the incision sites had healed well, and visible depressions

 were

observed

at

the

defect

locations,

with

evident

adhesion

to

the

underlying

tissues.

 Following

the

same

preoperative

preparation

and

anesthesia

protocol

as

before,

pigs

were

 placed

in

the

prone

position

and

the

surgical

site

on

the

posterior

neck

was

sterilized. An

 incision

was

made

along

the

longitudinal

axis

of

the

neck,

and

an

adequate

volume

of

 subcutaneous fat tissue was harvested. The incision was closed and compressed using a pressure

 dressing.

The

harvested

fat

was

cut

with

surgical

scissors

into

injectable

macrofat

for

 subsequent use, and remaining portion further processed into NF and AN gel. After releasing

 adhesions between the dermis and underlying tissues at each defect site, the three types of fillers

 were injected from the edge of each defect using a syringe. A volume of 7 mL was injected per

 defect, slightly overfilling the depression to a level just above the skin surface. The injection

 sites were closed with sutures. Postoperatively, animals received antibiotic prophylaxis for 3

 days to prevent infection.

 Statistical analysis

 Statistical analysis was performed using one-way or two-way ANOVA followed by Tukey’s

 post-hoc

test

using

GraphPad

Software

(Prism

v.10).

P

values

were

used

to

determine

 significant differences (NS at P >0.05, *P < 0.05,

**P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001, and

****P <

 0.0001).
