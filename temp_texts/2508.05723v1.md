 ABSTRACT

 Synthetic

virus-like

particles

(VLP),

designed

from

simplified

building

blocks,

can

reduce

the

 complexity

of

native

viral

proteins

and

be

tailored

for

specific

applications.

Using

molecular

 dynamics

simulations,

we

investigate

the

role

of

counterions

(H2PO4

-,

PO4

3-,

Cl-,

and

F-)

in

 stabilizing a pre-assembled virus-like shell formed by cationic peptides exemplified by synthetic

VLP

shells.

Our

 findings

reveal

that

polyatomic

anions

(H2PO4

-

and

PO4

3-)

facilitate

stable

assemblies

by

 condensing on the VLP shell to higher degrees, thereby neutralizing Coulombic repulsion among

 the

peptide

building

blocks.

Cohesion

is

largely

promoted

through

the

multidentate

hydrogen

 bonds

with

arginine:

Substituting

arginine

by

lysine

in

the

system

with

H2PO4

-

leads

to

 destabilization

of

the

structure.

H2PO4

-

additionally

engages

in

hydrophobic

interactions

with

 leucine side chains. By contrast, monoatomic anions (Cl- and F-) show insufficient coordination to

 the peptides and fail to stabilize the assembly, while supplementing F- with excess 1M NaCl can

 recover

the

structural

integrity

by

screening

electrostatic

interactions.

This

study

provides

 important insights into the role of counterions in molecular self-assembly and the nature of their

 interactions with amino-acid side chains involved in the cooperative formation and stabilization of

 synthetic virus-like shells.

 1. INTRODUCTION

 Viruses present a diverse range of naturally occurring nanomaterials that infect all forms of life

 including plants, animals, archaea and bacteria. Due to their conserved architectures and biological

 functions that can be mimicked by design, viruses have inspired the development of synthetic and

 semi-synthetic virus-like particles (VLPs) aiming at various applications. With intracellular gene

 delivery, which viruses mastered to perfection, VLPs are explored to capitalize on specific viral

 properties

e.g., the ability to encapsulate

molecular cargo applicable to therapy, imaging, and

 vaccine development.1,2 Furthermore, like other protein-based nanoparticles, protein-based VLPs

 have the advantages of suitable sizes, biocompatibility, and biodegradability.

 The

assembly

of

VLPs

rely

on

stable

protein-protein

interactions

(PPIs).3

PPIs

comprise

both

 hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions,

and are often specified by amphiphilicity, which helps

 define the shape and morphology of a given assembly.4‚Äì6 Additionally, protein-based VLPs with

 charged side chains in their constituent amino acids can interact with counterions, similar to the



peptide-based drugs that are frequently formulated as salts.7 Consequently, the influence of ions

 on PPIs is a significant factor in the formation and stability of VLPs. Studies have been conducted

 to explore the impact of salts or buffers on PPIs. For example, the polarizability of anions has been

 shown

to

modulate

PPIs8;

the

addition

of

salt

to

protein

solutions

can

induce

oligomerization,

 aggregation, and precipitation,8‚Äì10 which prove to be characteristic of other aqueous biological and

 colloidal systems that are subject to similar effects of counterions and excess salt.11‚Äì16

 The assembly of charged VLPs in the presence of counterions is closely related to the well-studied

 phenomenon of counterion condensation observed with macromolecules. This process has been

 investigated both experimentally and theoretically.17‚Äì23 Through the binding of oppositely charged

 ions

to

the

constituent

residue

side

chains

on

the

protein

surface,

long-range

electrostatic

 interactions are neutralized, enabling the formation of short-range ion-bridging forces that promote

 protein

association.24,25

However,

different

ions,

even

of

the

same

charge,

can

produce

varied

 effects.

For

instance,

the

Hofmeister

series

categorizes

ions

based

on

their

ability

to

influence

 protein

solubility, distinguishing

between "salting-in" and "salting-out" behaviors.11 This

series

 has been widely applied to characterize salt effects on protein solubility, polymer phase transitions,

 and the solubility of small molecules.13,26‚Äì28 Polyatomic or polydentate anions, which can support

 several hydrogen bonds, such as phosphate and sulfate exhibit stronger interactions with cationic

 peptide side chains compared to monovalent anions like chloride, as observed in electrophoretic

 3



 studies.21,22 However, all these observations are at the macroscopic scale, prompting the need for

 atomistic-level investigations to fully understand the mechanisms.

 The study by Noble et al.29 introduced

a novel synthetic VLP, which is based on the assembly of

 cationic

cyclopeptides

into

virus-like

shells,

dubbed

CycVir.

The

assembly

is

driven

by

the

 hydrophobicity of leucine residues, and electrostatic interactions between arginine residues and

 phosphate counterions via coordination. The current manuscript aims to contribute insights into

 the

counterion

selection

in

modulating

the

stability

of

CycVir.

The

effects

of

four

distinct

 counterions, namely H2PO4

-, PO4

3-, Cl-, F-, on the structural stability of CycVir were investigated.

 These

anions

were

chosen

because

of

their

different

salting-out

propensities

according

to

the

 Hoffmeister series. In addition, H2PO4

- and PO4

3- are main components in the phosphate buffer

 used

as

a

physiological

medium.

Trivalent

as

well

as

divalent

counterions,

are

well

known

to

 enhance cohesion between charged macromolecules by mediating ion-ion correlations and acting

 as bridges.30,31 Although the focus of this study is not on such multivalent-mediated binding, the

 inclusion

of

PO4

3-



allows

us

to

partly

address

this

effect

through

comparison

with

other

 monovalent

anions.

By

understanding

the

effects

of

the

counterions,

this

study

provides

a

 complementary

understanding

of

the

design

principles

and

points

to

practical

parameters

for

 optimizing VLP systems intended for use in different environments.

 Many valuable insights into the formation and stability of VLP shells have been obtained from

 coarse-grained

models,

particularly

those

that

explore

the

interplay

between

electrostatic

and

 hydrophobic

interactions.32‚Äì36

However,

such

models

often

lack

explicit

molecular

resolution,

 making it challenging to capture detailed peptide-counterion interactions and hydrogen-bonding

 patterns. By detailing interactions at atomistic scale obtained from the molecular dynamics (MD)

 4



 simulations, this study complements these coarse-grained approaches with specific ion effects that

 influence shell stability.



2. METHODS

 The CycVir model (Figure 1a), as described in the work of Noble et al.,29 was adopted. This

 model is assembled from tessellation units of three stacked peptides (sequence: cyc-Gln-DLeu-

Arg-DLeu-Arg-DLeu-Arg-DLeu, charge +3, shown in Figure 1b) totaling 432 cyclopeptides, with

 an initial radius set to 45 √Ö. The units were uniformly distributed on a sphere, with the normal of

 the peptide rings pointing radially. Experimentally, CycVir was found to be polydisperse.29 We

 chose

to

start

the

simulation

at

the

lower

end

of

the

experimentally

reported

size

range

taking

 measurement

uncertainty

into

account,

to

promote

hydrophobic

interactions

among

peptides

to

 establish from the outset. Conceivably, this initial packing could introduce local clashes, which

 may

lead

to

expansion

as

the

system

relaxes

toward

an

optimal

structure.

Figure

1c

shows

 ùúånorm(ùëü), the radial number density normalized by the

number of particles

ùëÅ

of the species

of

 interest.

Thus,

ùúånorm(ùëü) ‚ãÖ ùëÅ

gives

the

local

average

number

density

at

a

distance

ùëü

from

the

 assembly‚Äôs center of mass.

 MD

simulations

were

performed

on

this

pre-assembled

model

to

observe

its

stability

in

the

 presence of the counterions of choice. Our focus is not on simulating the dynamic processes of

 assembly or disassembly. This approach is motivated by experimental evidence indicating a low

 critical

aggregation

concentration29,

suggesting

that

once

formed,

the

VLP

shells

are

 thermodynamically stable. We then analyze the interactions that contribute to the cohesion for a

 stable assembly.

 The

simulations

were

performed

using

NAMD

2.1237

software

with

the

CHARMM36

force

 Ô¨Åeld,38,39 incorporating fluoride parameters from Orabi et al.40 The model CycVir was solvated in

 a box (175 √Ö √ó 173 √Ö √ó 172 √Ö) with TIP3P water.41 Periodic boundary conditions were imposed.

 All simulations were run using Langevin dynamics in the NPT ensemble at 298 K, and 1 bar with

 an isotropic coupling. The nonbonded interaction cutoff was set to 12 √Ö and the switch distance to

 10 √Ö. Bonds involving hydrogen were made rigid using the SHAKE algorithm.42 Electrostatics

 were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald approach.43 To balance the net positive charge of

 the peptides, 1296 H2PO4

-/Cl-/F- or 432 PO4

3- ions were randomly placed in the simulation cell.

 Generally, except in two, the simulations were performed without additional salt.

 For the simulations, restrained equilibrium runs totaling over 70‚ÄØns were performed prior to the

 production

run.

These

were

carried

out

in

two

stages

using

harmonic

restraints

on

the

peptide

 backbone, first with a force constant of 1‚ÄØkcal/mol/√Ö2 and then 0.1‚ÄØkcal/mol/√Ö2, both using a time

 step of 1‚ÄØfs. The production run used a 2‚ÄØfs time step, and convergence was considered achieved

 when the radius of gyration reached a plateau.

 To provide a picture of the composition of the converged structure, we examined the distribution

 of

species

in

the

studied

systems

by

calculating

ùúånorm(ùëü)

for

peptides,

counterions,

and

water.

 These calculations used specific atoms for each species from individual frames, averaged over the

 final

40

ns,

during

which

the

structure

had

stabilized.

The

selected

atoms

were

the

CŒ±

of

the

 glutamine residue for peptides, the phosphorus atom (P) for polyatomic counterions (H2PO4

3- -/ PO4

), F-, Cl-, and the oxygen atom for water. ùúånorm(ùëü) was evaluated using the center of mass, frame

 by frame, of the respective species type as the reference point.

 6



 Hydrogen bonds (HBs) between species of interest were evaluated for the final structure of each

 system using the criteria: the distance of 3 √Ö between two heavy atoms and the minimal angle of

 150¬∞ formed by the donor, hydrogen, and acceptor atoms. Furthermore, a 3 √Ö distance was used

 to

determine

whether

any

two

particles

were

associated,

such

as

condensed

counterions

on

 peptides. All analyses and visualization were done using VMD44 scripts.

 Additional

test

systems

different

from

the

above

setups

were

constructed

to

investigate

the

 interactions in more detail:



(1)

In

general,

simulations

were

performed

without

additional

salt

in

accordance

with

the

 experimental setups. However, to test the effects of Coulomb screening on VLP shell stability, one

 system referred to as F-

NaCl(1M) was prepared by adding 1M NaCl to the F- system which in this

 study was found to be unstable. The 1‚ÄØM concentration was chosen to provide strong electrostatic

 screening, corresponding to a Debye length (~3‚ÄØ√Ö) comparable to a typical

contact distance. For

 the

sake

of

completeness

and

to

test

the

effect

of

physiological

salinity,

an

additional

system

 containing 0.15 M NaCl (F-

NaCl(0.15M)) was also simulated.

 (2) To test whether specific interactions involving Arg play a role in stabilizing the assembly ,

 we made a model referred to as H2PO4

- R2K by replacing all Arg with Lys in the H2PO4

- system that

 was previously shown to form stable assembly in MD simulations.29 Furthermore, the choice of

 using the monovalent H2PO4

- system is also inspired by the RNA structure where the phosphate is

 typically monovalent and sometimes divalent. Such choice makes this test biologically relevant.

 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION



3.1. Assemblies Stabilized with H2PO4

-/ PO4

3- but Dispersed with F-/Cl-



7



 We used ùúånorm(ùëü) of the peptides to determine whether a hollow shell has been formed, as a

 zero density between the center and a finite radius indicates a hollow structure. The results are

 illustrated in Figure 2 which reveal that the assemblies are stable with H2PO4

- and PO4

3- whereas

 they are not in the cases of F- or Cl-. The results in Figure 2 are corroborated by the snapshots of

 the final configurations for the assemblies in Figure S1. Earlier studies suggest that high net charge

 leads to slow protein aggregation.45‚Äì51 For example, the amyloid formation by positively charged

 islet amyloid polypeptide is much slower at low pH than at neutral pH.52 Similarly here, with a net

 charge of +3 per peptide unit, the potentially difficult assembly of cationic CycVir peptides seems

 to

be

facilitated

by

the

presence

of

H2PO4

-

or

PO4

3-

counterions

and

results

in

hollow

vesicle

 structures, as shown in the top two panels of Figure 2. Both assemblies expanded compared to the

 initial structure, with the radius of gyration stabilizing at 55.5 √Ö for H2PO4

- and 60.9 √Ö for PO4

3-

 (Figure S2a). This expansion relieved initial packing clashes, resulting in a thicker and less dense

 shell without major positional rearrangement. As shown in Figure S2b, the center of mass of each

 peptide retains

the same neighboring

relationship as the initial

configuration, although the side

 chains as well as the normal of cyclopeptide rings point in various directions different from the

 initial highly ordered geometry. Notably, the PO4

3- system exhibited a larger empty volume than

 the H2PO4

- system. This difference in shell size is likely due to distinctions in the counterion charge

 and

their

total

number,

and

the

interactions

of

these

counterions

with

the

peptides

(discussed

 below).

 For the Cl- system, Figure 2 reveals similar radial distributions for all species, indicating that all

 peptides as well as Cl- are solvated by water, resulting in a fully dispersed system. In the case of

 F-, substantial peptide density is observed near their center of mass and spreads across the entire

 8



 space. Thus, with F-, peptides did not assemble into a hollow particle but instead formed a few

 oligomers.

 ùúånorm(ùëü)

of

H2PO4

-

and

PO4

3-

closely

follow

those

of

the

peptides,

indicating

that

these

 counterions condense on the peptide assembly. Conceivably, the extent of counterion condensation

 correlates with the stability of an otherwise highly charged assembly. Figure 3 shows the number

 of condensed counterions per peptide. The average numbers of condensed counterions

per Arg

 residue

over

the

last

40

ns

of

the

simulation

were

0.9,

0.7,

and

0.3

for

H2PO4

-,

F-,

and

Cl-,

 respectively.

The

PO4

3-

ions

were

fully

condensed

on

the

peptides.

For

PO4

3-

and

H2PO4

-,

the

 counterions

largely

neutralize

the

peptide

charge,

effectively

reducing

Coulombic

repulsion

 between peptides. In contrast, F- achieves only partial local charge neutralization, and Cl- provides

 little

reduction,

consistent

with

the

dispersed

assemblies.

Counterions

affecting

molecular

 aggregation has been previously reported by Desai et al.53, who suggested that larger anions form

 suitable pairs with

larger organic cations which is consistent with our results of H2PO4

-/PO4

3- and

 peptides. In the following, we will discuss in detail how H2PO4

- and PO4

3- exhibit the high degree

 of interaction with the peptides.

 3.2. Details of Interactions in the System

 The initial CycVir model is a regular tessellation-like assembly of elementary units assembled

 from three cyclopeptides stacked together, and the final converged configuration, in case of stable

 assembly,

largely

retains

the

initial

neighboring

relationship

between

the

units

(Figure

S2b).

 Ghadiri

et

al.54

reported

that

cyclic

D,L-ÔÅ°-peptides

form

extended

stacks

resulting

in

hollow

 tubular structures, driven by backbone-backbone hydrogen bonding. Although CycVir by design

 9





 does not adopt a tubular structure, it is still of interest to assess the degree of peptide association

 through

backbone

HBs

between

peptides

within

stacks.

We

calculated

the

radial

distribution

 function (RDF) of backbone hydrogens around backbone carbonyl oxygens. In both the PO4

3- and

 H2PO4

-

systems,

the

RDF

revealed

only

two

such

hydrogens

within

3.85

√Ö

of

each

carbonyl

 oxygen, indicating, if any, weak backbone HB associations. This means that HBs of the backbone

 are not the main driver of self-assembly, suggesting that additional interactions via peptide side

 chains

are

required

to

form

stable

assemblies.

Furthermore,

the

lateral

interactions

of

the

side

 chains enable the formation of higher dimensional structures as suggested by Insua et al.55, who

 showed that 1D tubular structures can evolve into 2D nanosheets. Below, we report the analyses

 of HBs, hydration levels, as well as close contacts, and explore how counterion mediates the side

 chain lateral interactions.

 3.2.1. Hydrogen bonding and hydration analysis: Electrostatic interactions plays a major role

 for counterion condensation22. Our analysis shows that PO4

3- has the strongest counterion-peptide

 interaction as indicated by its higher probability of forming HBs (Table 1 and Figure 4). PO4

3-

 forms an average of six HBs per ion, whereas fewer are formed by H2PO4

- and F-. Notably, Cl-

 forms no HBs with our calculation criteria, indicating a lack of interaction with peptides which is

 consistent

with

the

observation

that

its

first

hydration

shell

remains

largely

unaffected

by

the

 presence of peptides, unlike the other anions (Table 2).

Table 3 shows the number of counterions

 that form HBs with two or more peptides thence bridge them. PO4

3- shows a high ratio (94%) of

 condensed ions forming bridging HBs. The ratios for F- and H2PO4

- are lower and both about 30%.

 The phosphate systems led to stable assembly while CycVir dispersed in the F- system. Apart from

 its strong hydration propensity, the fact that F- is a monoatomic ion can also be the reason: even

 though it can coordinate to the Arg of two neighboring peptides, it cannot form multidentate HBs

 10



 to

the

same

extent

as

H2PO4

-

does.

Figure

5

depicts

counterions

forming

HBs

with

multiple

 peptides: a PO4

3- ion bridging six peptides (a); one H2PO4

- ion coordinating with three peptides

 (b); and one F- forming connections to two peptides (c). Both PO4

3- and H2PO4

- form multidentate

 connections, while F- forms monodentate HBs and is conceivably less effective in reducing the

 Coulomb repulsion between Arg side chains. These findings highlight that the stability of peptide

 assemblies is not solely determined by the number of hydrogen bonds but also by their multidentate

 nature that enhances bridging efficiency.

 Counterion hydration varies with ion type which may influence peptide assembly stability. Table

 2

shows

that

PO4

3-

and

H2PO4

-

exhibit

reduced

hydration

shells

in

the

presence

of

peptides

 compared to bulk solution, indicating partial dehydration as they bind to peptides. In contrast, F-

 and

Cl-

remain

largely

hydrated,

with

Cl-

showing

negligible

interaction

with

peptides

as

 previously discussed. It is consistent with the HB analysis above, that F- remains highly hydrated

 therefore exhibits lower binding affinity to the peptides relative to PO4

3- and H2PO4

-.

 Shifting

the

focus

to

the

hydration

of

the

peptides

themselves:

The

association

of

charged

 peptides, facilitated by the replacement of water in their solvation shells with other peptides, can

 be driven by counterions, as suggested by the Hofmeister series. We evaluate the average number

 of water molecules surrounding each peptide: 49 for PO4

3-, 33 for H2PO4

-, 51 for F-, and 57 for Cl-

 ion systems, respectively. These results confirm that the properties of the protein‚Äìsolvent system

 vary with counterion. Peptides in the H2PO4

- system have the lowest hydration levels and are thus

 mostly precipitated which aligns with the observation of stable assembly. In contrast, peptides in

 the

Cl-

system

are

the

most

hydrated

and

exhibit

the

least

precipitation,

consistent

with

the

 instability of their assembly. Considering only the monovalent counterions (H2PO4

-, F-, Cl-), the

 hydration level of peptides appears to inversely correlate with the stability of the peptide assembly.

 11



 However, there are more water molecules per peptide with PO4

3- than with H2PO4

- and yet both

 assemblies are stable. This can be explained by the smaller number of PO4

3- ions (432) compared

 to H2PO4

- ions (1296), resulting in less water being displaced. The stability of the assembly in the

 case

of

PO4

3-

is

likely

driven

by

this

multidentate

ion‚Äôs

strong

tendency

to

form

numerous

 hydrogen bonds, which matches the ability of Arg side chains to support up to five hydrogen bonds

 per residue.



3.2.2. Hydrophobic interactions: Although H2PO4

- forms slightly more hydrogen bonds to the

 peptides

than

F-,

the

sum

of

hydrogen

bonds

and

coordinated

water

still

falls

below

the

bulk

 coordination

number.

This

suggests

the

potential

involvement

of

other

interactions

between

 CycVir

and

H2PO4

-.

To explore

this

further,

interactions

between

counterions

and

peptide

side

 chains are examined in more detail. Figure 7 shows the number of peptides whose Arg (a) and D-

Leu

(b)

side

chains

form

contacts

with

F-,

H2PO4

-,

and

PO4

3-.

Notably,

H2PO4

-

establishes

 significant contacts with not only hydrophilic Arg, but also hydrophobic D-Leu side chains with

 420 out of 432 peptides on average, whereas F- mainly associates with Arg, and PO4

3- exclusively

 interacts with Arg. This is consistent with the expectation that Arg can form ion pairs with anionic

 counterions;

however,

it

is

striking

that

H2PO4

-

also

interacts

substantially

with

D-Leu.

 Conceivably, Arg‚Äìphosphate interactions immobilize H2PO4

-, enabling its dihydrogen moiety to

 form stable contacts with the side chains of D-Leu residues. Figure S3 provides a representative

 snapshot

illustrating

a

typical

contact

to

D-Leu

by

the

dihydrogen

region

of

an

H2PO4

-,

which

 incidentally

bridges

to

an

Arg

of

a

neighboring

peptide.

The

analysis

showed

that

70%

of

the

 condensed

H2PO4

-

formed

bridges

between

Arg/Gln

and

D-Leu.

Thus,

beyond

electrostatic

 interactions

with

hydrophilic

residues,

H2PO4

-

contributes

additional

stability

to

the

assembly

 through hydrophobic interactions with D-Leu side chains. This specific binding via hydrophobic

 12



 interactions differentiates H2PO4

- from F- in CycVir assembly. Lund et

al.56 similarly observed

 with

a

model

macromolecule

that

specific

anion

binding

is

influenced

by

local

interactions,

 following two molecular mechanisms: smaller ions like F- bind through strong, localized charge-

charge interactions, while larger anions can associate through a combination of

ion pairing and

 delocalized hydrophobic interactions. Our results demonstrate that counterions along with peptides

 participate in the interplay of hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions that sustain the stability of

 the peptide assembly.

 Additional simulation replicas were performed for the H2PO4

- and PO4

3- systems to further confirm

 the observed stability and interaction patterns. Comparisons between the two trajectories revealed

 excellent consistency, as shown in Supporting Information Figures S4‚ÄìS10 as well as Tables S1‚Äì

S3.

 3.2.3. Electrostatic screening with excess salt:

Both ion binding and electrostatic screening

 impact protein electrostatic interactions.57‚Äì59 Having discussed the former, we proceed to examine

 the

effect

of

increasing

electrostatic

screening

on

an

otherwise

unsuccessful

assembly.

 Specifically, and as proof of principle, we added 1M NaCl to the F- system (denoted by F-

NaCl(1M))

 to test whether enhanced electrostatic screening could stabilize the CycVir assembly. It was found

 that the shell remained stable (Figure 6a). The radial peptide density shows a hollow vesicle profile

 with increased magnitude at the region corresponding to the shell radius (Figure 6b). The addition

 of 1M NaCl, however, neither altered the amount of HBs between F‚Åª and peptides nor changed the

 amount

of

F-

condensation

(maintaining

~2

ions

per

peptide).

This

is

consistent

with

these

 interactions occurring at distances shorter than the Debye length (~3√Ö for 1 M NaCl(aq)) and thus

 not significantly screened by excess salt.

In contrast, the inter-peptide Coulomb repulsion, which

 acts over longer distances, is reduced, allowing, e.g., (1) shorter distance between the side chains

 13



 of Arg without clearly more F- ions to bridge peptides (Table 3); we

see that the coordination

 number

to

water

remains

virtually

unchanged

(Table

2).

(2)

hydrophobic

interactions

among

 peptides

(via

D-Leu,

as

illustrated

in

Figure

1D

in

the

work

of

Noble

et

al.29)

to

stabilize

the

 assembly. We found that each D-Leu side chain, on average, forms at least one contact with a D-

Leu side chain of another peptide, as observed in systems with H2PO4

- or PO4

3-.

Thus, we propose

 that hydrophobicity plays an enhanced role in aggregation in the scenario of F-

NaCl(1M). As for the

 additional Cl-, its ùúånorm(ùëü) follows the same distribution as water, again indicating that Cl- does

 not interact with the peptides.

 A natural question is whether stabilization could also occur under physiological conditions of

 0.15 M NaCl. To answer this question, we reduced the NaCl concentration of the above model to

 0.15 M and performed the simulation of the new model, F-

NaCl(0.15M). Instead of giving a plateaued

 radius of gyration, the initially packed shell started to break into less connected fragments (Figure

 S11a).

In

both

the

salt-free

and

1‚ÄØM

NaCl

systems,

roughly

one-third

of

the

F-

ions

remain

 uncondensed

(Table

3)

and

contribute

to

bulk

electrostatic

screening.

Given

the

size

of

the

 simulation cell, the concentration of free F- is just slightly below physiological salinity. While this

 additional

contribution

is

negligible

in

the

1‚ÄØM

NaCl

system,

it

increases

the

effective

ionic

 strength in the 0.15‚ÄØM case. Still, the added salt is insufficient to stabilize the shell. In a real, larger

 system, the relative concentration of free F- would be much lower, implying that the combined

 (0.15M

NaCl

+

free

ions)

screening

would

still

be

insufficient.

The

results

on

solvation,

 condensation, and hydrogen bonding of fluoride corresponding to F-

NaCl(0.15M), shown in Figure 3

 and Tables 1-3, display similarities to those of F- and F-

NaCl(1M). This observation further strengthens

 that, instead of the above factors, adequate Coulomb screening,

as in the

F-

NaCl(1M) system, is a

 14



 prerequisite

in

order

to

allow

the

hydrophobic

interaction

between

peptides

in

the

case

of

F-

 counterions.

 3.2.4. Arginine-phosphate interactions: Although most of the anions in this study form HBs

 mainly with Arg, the peptide binding appears more effective for H2PO4

- and PO4

3- than F-. Using

 ionic charges to estimate electrostatics does not explain this difference. Lenton et al. pointed out

 the impact of Arg-phosphate interactions on the reentrant condensation of proteins.60 Thus, the

 specific interactions between Arg and phosphate counterions may bring additional attraction that

 contributes to the stability of CycVir. The side chain of Arg consists of a guanidinium moiety,

 whose interactions with phosphate, sulfate, and DNA have also been observed in many previous

 works.21,56,61‚Äì63

 To test this assumption, we substituted all Arg to Lys in the CycVir‚ÄìH2PO4

- system (denoted by

 H2PO4

- R2K) since this system is stable in its non-mutated form. Substituting Arg with Lys maintains

 the

charge

but

removes

the

guanidinium-phosphate

interaction.

The

substitution

results

in

a

 disassembled structure halfway through the equilibration process (Figure S11b) and only half of

 the HBs with peptides being formed compared to that with the non-mutated shell (Table 1). Water

 coordination numbers of the first hydration shell of H2PO4

- differ less in the presence of mutated

 CycVir

(Table

2).

Fewer

H2PO4

-

are

condensed

to

the

peptides

and

even

fewer

of

them

form

 bridging HBs (Table 3). This test shows that beyond electrostatic attraction between counter ions

 and charged residues, the additional contribution of specific interaction (preference of multidentate

 guanidinium-phosphate interaction in this case) is needed for a stable assembly, consistent with

 the observed effectiveness

of

phosphate binding

to CycVir. The preference of Arg over Lys

is

 observed in nature: e.g., DNA compaction via Arg-rich protamines,63, Arg-rich motifs on proteins

 are known to bind RNA and are involved in regulating RNA processing in viruses and cells,64 and

 15



 it has also been shown that the interaction between Arg‚àíphosphate is considerably stronger than

 that of Lys‚àíphosphate.60,61,63

 Our study provides insights into the assembly mechanisms and stability of cationic virus-like

 shells exemplified by CycVir. Namely, counterions (1) modify PPIs resulting in reduced Coulomb

 repulsion;

(2)

form

hydrogen

bonds

that

bridge

peptides;

(3)

can

establish

hydrophobic

 interactions. We also

found that

specific interactions

in

the form

of multidentate HBs

between

 phosphate and Arg stabilize the peptide assembly. Notably, both phosphate buffer species, H2PO4

-

 and PO4

3- stabilize VLPs albeit through slightly different interacting mechanisms with the peptides.

 The observed differences between H2PO4

- , PO4

3- and F-, Cl- agree with the Hofmeister series65

 and may also offer insights into the origins of the series.

 We

started

the

simulations

from

a

pre-assembled

structure

which

may

restrict

exploration

of

 alternative morphologies. Nevertheless, the observed interactions between residues on peptides

 and counterions

are general and not specific to

a particular morphology. These interactions are

 also

relevant

to

assemblies

formed

from

any

charged

peptides

or

molecules,

not

limited

to

 cyclopeptides.

It

is

also

worth

noting that each simulation

provides robust sampling

due to

the

 collective

dynamics

of

432

peptides

and

1296

monovalent

counterions,

effectively

capturing

 hundreds

of

thousands

of

peptide‚Äìpeptide

and

peptide‚Äìion

interactions.

This

extensive

internal

 sampling lends statistical weight to the observed behavior, even within a single trajectory. The

 consistency between independent

replicas for the

H2PO4

- and PO4

3- systems,

as documented in

 Supporting Information Figures S4‚ÄìS10 and Tables S1‚ÄìS3, reflects this statistical robustness.

 4. CONCLUSION

 16



 Using

MD

simulations

on

the

model

of

CycVir,

we

demonstrated

with

atomistic

detail

that

 H2PO4

- and PO4

3- counterions in contrast to Cl- and F-, are effective in stabilizing the assembly of

 cationic

virus-like

shells

by

altering

the

properties

of

the

protein‚àíprotein

and

protein‚àísolvent

 system, by speciÔ¨Åc binding, or by locally neutralizing electrostatic interactions through counterion

 condensation.

 Specifically, our results

showed that

Coulomb interactions

between peptides

and counterions

 alone do not fully explain different outcomes by different counterions. The number density profiles

 of polyatomic anions

show higher degrees

of counterion

condensation on CycVir, achieved by

 extensive

hydrogen

bonding

for

PO4

3-,

and

by

hydrogen

bonding

as

well

as

hydrophobic

 interaction with the D-Leu side chains for H2PO4

-. Notably, these interactions bridge peptides and

 thereby stabilize their assembly. Conversely, Cl- forms no hydrogen bonds, and although F- shows

 peptide binding,

it

does

not

bridge peptides

extensively nor form

hydrophobic

interaction with

 them as does H2PO4

- and is therefore insufficient to sustain a stable assembly.

 Although

high

degree

of

counterion-peptide

binding

correlates

to

VLP

structure

stability

by

 neutralizing

the

repulsion

between

the

peptides,

we

showed

that

the

hydrophobic

PPI

can

also

 sustain the CycVir assembly when the Coulombic repulsion is screened by 1M NaCl demonstrated

 with the F- system.

 Specific

interactions

between

arginine

and

phosphate

contribute

to

the

effective

multidentate

 peptide binding and in turn the VLP stability, as was shown by substituting arginine with lysine,

 resulting

in

dispersed

assembly,

thereby

supporting

the

importance

of

arginine-phosphate

 interaction.



17



 These

findings

offer

broader

implications,

particularly

for

designing

VLPs

with

tailored

 functionalities, e.g., in gene therapies where peptide-phosphate interactions play a crucial role in

 RNA/DNA encapsulation and release.66‚Äì71
