# Abstract

 Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) represent a promising therapeutic avenue for human

 diseases, particularly in cancer treatment. Systematic elucidation of structure-activity

 relationships (SARs) and accurate prediction of the activity of PDCs are critical for the

 rational design and optimization of these conjugates. To this end, we carefully design

 1





 and construct a benchmark PDCs dataset compiled from literature-derived collections

 and

PDCdb

database,

and

then

develop

PDCNet,

the

first

unified

deep

learning

 framework

for

forecasting

the

activity

of

PDCs.

The

architecture

systematically

 captures

the

complex

factors

underlying

anticancer

decisions

of

PDCs

in

real-word

 scenarios

through

a

multi-level

feature

fusion

framework

that

collaboratively

 characterizes and learns the features of peptides, linkers, and payloads. Leveraging a

 curated PDCs benchmark dataset, comprehensive evaluation results show that PDCNet

 demonstrates superior predictive capability, with the highest AUC, F1, MCC and BA

 scores

of

0.9213,

0.7656,

0.7071

and

0.8388

for

the

test

set,

outperforming

eight

 established traditional machine learning models. Multi-level validations, including 5-

fold cross-validation, threshold testing, ablation studies, model interpretability analysis

 and

external

independent

testing,

further

confirm

the

superiority,

robustness,

and

 usability

of

the

PDCNet

architecture. We

anticipate

that

PDCNet

represents

a

novel

 paradigm,

incorporating

both

a

benchmark

dataset

and

advanced

models,

which

can

 accelerate the design and discovery of new PDC-based therapeutic agents.

# Introduction

 The concept of “magic bullets”, first proposed by Paul Ehrlich in 1913, represents

 a ground-breaking therapeutic paradigm aimed at delivering cytotoxic agents to cancer

 cells

with

high

specificity.

This

innovative

approach

envisions

the

use

of

targeted

 carriers to guide potent drugs to malignant cells, thereby minimizing damage to healthy

 tissues1, 2. In accordance with this pioneering vision, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs)

 have

emerged

as

the

first

practical

realization

of

this

concept3,

4. ADCs

are

intricate

2





 molecular

constructs

comprising

three

essential

components: a

monoclonal antibody

 that selectively binds to specific cancer cell surface antigens, a stable chemical linker

 that connects the antibody to the payload, and a highly potent cytotoxic agent5. Despite

 the remarkable achievements of ADCs in the field of cancer treatment, they still face

 limitations

stemming

from

the

large

molecular

size

of

antibodies,

poor

tumor

 penetration, high immunogenicity, and high production costs6, 7, 8.

 Peptide-drug conjugates (PDCs) have emerged as a transformative class of targeted

 oncology therapeutics, increasingly recognized as next-generation successors to ADCs

 9. Structurally analogous to ADCs, PDCs are macromolecular systems that conjugate

 cytotoxic

agents

to

tumor-targeting

peptides

or

cell-penetrating

peptides

through

the

 use of appropriate linkers10. While maintaining architectural similarities with ADCs in

 their

linker-mediated

drug-carrier

configuration,

PDCs

exhibit

a

distinct

molecular

 weight profile of 1-5 kDa, contrasting sharply with the 160 kDa antibody framework

 characteristic of ADCs. Peptides, as integral components of proteins, exhibit selectivity,

 reduced immunogenicity, and targeted action11. Moreover, the high receptor specificity

 of targeting peptides also aids in mitigating the off-target toxicity associated with small-

molecule

drugs12.

The

mechanism

of

PDCs

is

illustrated

in

Fig.

1a.

PDCs

usually

 conjugate to cell-penetrating peptides to enter cancer cells via transmembrane-mediated

 internalization, whereas those conjugated to cell-targeting peptides enter via receptor-

mediated endocytosis13. PDCs demonstrate enhanced anticancer efficacy

comparable

 to

conventional

small-molecule

drugs.

For

example, TH1902,

as

a

novel

docetaxel-

peptide

conjugate

targeting

the

Sortilin

(SORT1)

receptor14,

showed

enhanced

 3



 apoptotic

effects

compared

to

free

docetaxel.

Currently,

17

candidates

currently

in

 clinical

development

demonstrate

advantages

in

cancer

treatment.

However,

the

 stability and targeting efficiency of peptides, the ability of linkers to

enable payload

 release, and the potent cytotoxicity of the payloads all pose considerable challenges in

 the development of PDCs10, 15.

 Compared to small-molecule drugs, the rational computational design of peptide-

drug conjugates (PDCs) remains underexplored due to their structural complexity, with

 current

development

predominantly

relying

on

empirical

approaches.

Recent

 advancements demonstrate the potential of computational strategies in targeted PDC

 design. For instance, Zhang et al. utilized molecular dynamics simulations and binding

 free

energy

calculations

to

design

ROR1-targeting

peptide

mimetics,

followed

by

 computer-aided

virtual

mutation

analysis

to

optimize

the

peptide

sequences16.

This

 approach yielded peptides with nanomolar-level affinity, and enabled the construction

 of PDCs, among which compound II-3 exhibited remarkable antitumor activity against

 MDA-MB-231 cells and pharmacokinetic properties, validating computational efficacy

 in

PDC

design.

Similar,

Muratspahić

et

al.

integrated

Rosetta-based

protein

design,

 cryo-EM structures, and molecular dynamics to develop a κ-opioid receptor (KOR)-

targeted

PDC17. Their

optimized

conjugate,

DNCP-β-NalA

(1),

exhibited

high

KOR

 affinity, selectivity, and G-protein-biased activation, mitigating β-arrestin-related side

 effects. In vivo studies confirmed its analgesic efficacy without motor impairment or

 sedation.

Despite

these

successes,

the

field

lacks

robust

computational

tools

to

 systematically

elucidate

structure-activity

relationships

(SARs)

and

predict

PDCs

 activity. Current methods, while effective for specific targets, remain fragmented and

 lack

generalizability,

hindering

the

development

of

unified

frameworks

for

rational

 PDC design and discovery. Although deep learning has made significant progress in

 predicting

molecular

properties18,

19,

20,

21,

22,

discovering

active

compounds23,

24,

and

 generating molecules25, to the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports on the

 application of deep learning technologies to the development of PDC drugs.

 PDCs benchmark dataset analysis and visualization

 To

date,

no

standardized

dataset

has

existed

in

the

PDC

field

for

exploring

 structure-activity

relationships

and

activity

prediction.

To

address

this

gap,

we

 established a standardized workflow (Fig. 1b) and constructed the first benchmark PDC

 dataset.

Following

rigorous

standardization,

we

developed

a

modeling-ready

dataset

 comprising 834 anticancer PDCs. Each entry incorporates three key components: the

 peptide sequence, linker SMILES, and payload SMILES (Fig. 1c). Among these, 209

 PDCs were labelled as “1” (i.e. “active”), whereas 625 PDCs were labelled as “0” (i.e.

 “inactive”). As shown in Fig. 2a, the number of unique peptides, linkers, and payloads

 are 408, 231, and 202, respectively, indicating the structural diversity of PDCs in the

 dataset. Dataset analysis revealed 2 clinically approved PDCs, 16 in clinical trials, 1

 undergoing preclinical development, and the remainder (815) in exploratory research

 phases (Fig. 2b). Given that the characteristics of three components (peptide, linker and

 6





 payload) in a PDC play a critical role in maintaining their activities, we analyzed the

 distributions of these PDC components in this dataset.

 As

peptide

length

is

a

critical

factor

influencing

the

stability

of

PDCs

and

cell

 membrane permeability28, 29, the distribution of peptide lengths (Fig. 2c) illustrates that

 the majority of PDCs have peptides of 20 amino acids or fewer. Specifically, the number

 of PDCs within 10 amino acids reaches 508. Fig. 2d illustrates the frequency of each of

 the

20

standard

amino

acids,

demonstrating

that

Arg,

Lys,

and

Gly

are

the

most

 7





 frequently

occurring

amino

acids

in

these

peptide

items.

We

further

analyzed

the

 receptors targeted by the PDCs in this dataset as shown in Fig. 2e. These receptors can

 be

divided

into

three

main

categories,

of

which

the

top

three

most

common

are

 Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR), receptor tyrosine-protein kinase

 erbB-2 (ErbB2) and somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2).

 In PDC design, the payload serves as the therapeutic core whose rational selection

 dictates targeting precision and safety. As shown in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b, ten payloads

 including doxorubicin, daunorubicin, campathecin are widely used to design various

 PDCs for potential cancer treatment, highlighting that the predominant payload types

 in

the

dataset

are

highly

cytotoxic

drugs,

consistent

with

the

established

design

 paradigm for PDCs30.

 In PDCs, linkers chemically connect the peptide carrier to the therapeutic payload.

 They ensure stability during systemic circulation, prevent premature drug release, and

 enable

controlled

activation

at

the

target

site

(e.g.,

via

enzymatic

cleavage,

pH

 sensitivity, or redox conditions), optimizing drug delivery, reducing off-target toxicity,

 and enhancing therapeutic efficacy. To characterize these linkers, we classified them

 into twelve structural categories based on similarity. Fig. 3c presents the distribution of

 linkers across these categories, while Fig. 3d shows the most frequently occurring types,

 including

amide

bond,

succinimidyl

thioether

bond,

ester

bond,

disulfide

bond,

and

 glutaryl linkers. These results highlight the extensive structural diversity of linkers in

 the PDC modeling dataset.

 Furthermore, we found that in the PDCNet modeling dataset, the proportions of

 linkers and payload

scaffolds were 11.69%

and

56.44%,

respectively

(Fig. 3e). This

 distribution

may

reflect

the

current

status

of

PDC

design:

during

PDC

structural

 optimization,

researchers

tend to

modify

the

structures

of linkers

to

improve

release

 efficiency, while making relatively fewer changes to payload scaffolds. This is because

 the primary role of linkers is to stabilize conjugation and control release, and modifying

 linkers is more likely to generate novel PDC structures. Modifications to payloads often

 cause

them

to

deviate

from

the

structures

of

marketed

drugs,

which

may

lead

to

 uncertain additional toxicity issues. In addition, the AlogP and molecular weight (MW)

 of the linkers and payloads were computed to analyze the chemical space of the PDCs

 modelling dataset. Fig. 3f and 3g reveal that the chemical space spanned by the linkers

 (MW: 18.015–1399.509; AlogP: -5.458–5.767) and payloads (MW: 19.009–1669.615;

 AlogP: -7.573–12.949) in the dataset is expansive, further demonstrating the chemical

 diversity

of

the

dataset.

Collectively,

the

PDC

modelling

dataset

constructed

in

this

 study

exhibits

a

wide

range

of

chemical

space,

extensive

structural

diversity,

and

 compositional

complexity,

which

poses

challenges

to

computational

methods

in

 predicting

the

anticancer

activities

of

PDCs.

Of

course,

computational

models

built

 based

on

this

dataset

can

not

only

fully

simulate

PDCs

in

the

real

world,

but

also

 10



 enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model in predicting the activity of this class

 of drugs.

 Architecture and performance of PDCNet

 Although

PDCs

represent

a

critically

important

class

of

therapeutic

agents,

 particularly in the field of cancer treatment, their current design and discovery remain

 predominantly

experience-driven.

To

the

best

of

our

knowledge,

no

computational

 methods or predictive models

have been reported to data that elucidate the complex

 SARs

of

PDC

and

predict

their

activity.

In

this

study,

we

developed

the

PDCNet

 framework (Fig. 1c) that systematically learns the distinct characteristics of three PDC

 components

(peptide,

linker,

and

payload)

to

attempt

accurate

explore

the

SARs

of

 PDCs and activity prediction. Furthermore, we established traditional machine learning

 approaches as baseline models for predictive performance comparison with PDCNet.

 Notably,

despite

being

considered

baseline

models,

they

represent

the

first

 computational

models

for

PDC

activity

prediction.

For

fair

comparison,

all

models

 were trained and tested with three different random seeds, maintaining the same data

 split proportion

and

method. The average

of the

three

runs

was adopted

as the

final

 evaluation metrics for model prediction performance.

 The performance metrics of PDCNet and eight baseline models are presented in

 Table 1 for the test set. As shown Table 1, our PDCNet model demonstrates superior

 predictive

performance

compared

to

eight

baselines.

For

one

thing,

given

the

 pronounced class imbalance on the PDCs modelling dataset, we pay particular attention

 to

the

four

key

metrics

of

F1, AUC,

MCC

and BA.

First,

it

is

evident

that

PDCNet

 11



 achieves

the highest

F1

score

(0.7656), demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting

 minority class samples. Additionally, PDCNet also achieves the highest AUC (0.9213),

 dictating its capacity to effectively discriminate between positive and negative samples,

 while concurrently managing false positives and false negatives in a balanced manner.

 This ability is of particular significance when dealing with imbalanced datasets. Further

 analytical

results

demonstrate

 that

PDCNet

achieves

38.46%

and

23.83%

 improvements

in

AUC

compared

to

the

weakest

and

strongest

baseline

models

 (RF_Morgan

and

LR_Morgan),

respectively.

This

substantial

performance

gap

 unequivocally

confirms

the

architectural

superiority

of

PDCNet

in

addressing

the

 compositional complexity inherent to PDCs. The F1 score and AUC are complementary

 metrics,

and

the

excellent

performance

of

PDCNet

in

both

of

them

highlights

its

 outstanding

ability

to

distinguish

between

different

classes

in

the

imbalanced

PDCs

 dataset and its capacity to accurately identify the minority classes. Meanwhile, PDCNet

 exhibits robust stability, as evidenced by achieving the highest scores on MCC (0.7071)

 and

BA

(0.8388),

which

are

well-suited

for

comprehensively

evaluating

the

 performance of this model on imbalanced dataset32, 33.

 For

another,

PDCNet

attained

the

highest

values

on

PRAUC

(0.7363),

PPV

 (0.8131), and NPV (0.9250), which collectively indicate that PDCNet can effectively

 minimize both false positives and false negatives, thereby ensuring the reliability of its

 predictive

outcomes.

Furthermore,

the

high

SE

(0.7239)

of

the

PDCNet

further

 underscores

its

ability

to

accurately

identify

true

positives,

representing

the

most

 substantial improvement over baseline models, which achieved SE values in the range

 12



 of 0.38–0.56. Notably, PDCNet and all baseline models achieved remarkably consistent

 high specificity (SP) values (range: 0.9084–0.9593), demonstrating robust performance

 in

identifying

true

negative

samples.

This

observation

aligns

with

prior

studies

 indicating

that

class-imbalanced

datasets

inherently

favor

high

specificity

when

 negative

samples

dominate34.

Crucially,

PDCNet

maintained

this

baseline-level

SP

 while

simultaneously

achieving

the

aforementioned

sensitivity

(SE)

improvements,

 demonstrating its a dual capability critical for therapeutic applications requiring both

 precision in minority-class detection (e.g., active PDCs) and reliability in majority-class

 exclusion (e.g., inactive PDCs). Furthermore, PDCNet demonstrates superior overall

 predictive

performance

with

the

highest

ACC

value

of

0.9036.

Collectively,

these

 findings

not

only

demonstrate

the

superior

predictive

performance

of

the

PDCNet

 model but also indirectly illustrate the advanced nature of PDCNet architecture, which

 enables it to better handle the inherent complexity of PDC drugs.

 All models are trained and tested with three random seeds (1~3), the same data split proportion and

 5-fold cross-validation for PDCNet model

 To evaluate the reliability and stability of the PDCNet model, we employed 5-fold

 cross-validation, a method particularly suitable for addressing classification imbalance

 and

small

to

medium

sized

datasets. As

shown

in

Fig.

4a,

the

outcomes

of

cross-

validation aligned consistently with those from standard training across all evaluation

 metrics,

indicating

that

PDCNet

possesses

excellent

generalization

capabilities

and

 stability. With regard to the characteristics of the PDCNet benchmark dataset, we focus

 on the four metrics: BA, MCC, AUC and ACC. Specifically, the average MCC, BA,

 ACC and AUC of the 5-fold cross-validation are 0.7840 ± 0.0779, 0.8794 ± 0.0536,

 0.9194 ± 0.0308 and 0.9464 ± 0.0572, respectively. These

results showed negligible

 differences compared to these obtained from the previously trained PDCNet model. In

 14



 summary, the 5-fold cross-validation demonstrated that the PDCNet model has robust

 stability and generalization ability.

 Activity threshold-based evaluation confirms the efficacy of PDCNet

 With the aim of examining the robustness and generalization ability of our model,

 we further adopted another threshold to judge the activity/inactivity of the PDCs in the

 benchmark dataset, Concretely, we now labelled PDCs with IC50, EC50 and GI50 below

 0.1 μM in the cell viability assays as “1” (active), and otherwise as “0” (inactive). PDCs

 that have been tested in animals, entered clinical trials, or have been marketed are still

 labelled

as

active. After

retraining,

Fig.

4b

shows

that

there

is

not

much

difference

 between the model training results under two different activity judgement thresholds.

 For example, the values of MCC, AUC, PRAUC, and F1 after retraining are 0.6163,

 0.8674, 0.6775, and 0.7284, respectively, which are consistent with the performance of

 the results (0.7071, 0.9213, 0.7363, 0.7656) obtained by training with the initial activity

 judgement thresholds. This observation signifies that PDCNet not only exhibits notable

 robustness and generalization capability, but also has a strong anti-interference ability

 to potential noise or boundary samples in the data. Considering the characteristics of

 the existing PDCs benchmark dataset, we propose that selecting an activity threshold

 of 1 μM is scientifically justified.

 Ablation experiments

 As shown in Fig. 1c, PDCNet is a multipath architecture that can learn and combine

 useful

information

of

the

peptides,

linkers,

and

payloads

involved

in

the

PDCs.

To

 further investigate the necessity of these three well-designed feature extraction modules,

 we conducted ablation experiments by designing five variants of PDCNet: 1) PDCNet

 without

peptide

embedding

information

(w/o

embed)

in

peptide

feature

extraction

 16



 module;

2)

PDCNet

without

peptide

encoding

information

(w/o

encode)

in

peptide

 feature

extraction

module;

3)

PDCNet

without

peptide

information

(w/o

peptide)

in

 peptide feature extraction module; 4) PDCNet without linker information (w/o linker)

 in linker feature extraction module ; and 5) PDCNet without payload information (w/o

 payload)

in

payload

feature

extraction

module.

The

five

variants

of

PDCNet

were

 rigorously evaluated on the standardized PDC benchmark dataset, maintaining identical

 experimental configurations with the original PDCNet framework to ensure equitable

 comparative analysis.

 As

shown

in

Fig.

5,

all

five

architectural

variants

of

PDCNet

exhibited varying

 degrees

of

performance

degradation

across

four

critical

metrics

(F1,

BA, AUC,

and

 MCC). Notably, the exclusion of payload information resulted in the most severe metric

 deterioration, rendering the model nearly inoperable. Specifically, F1 score plummeted

 from 0.7656 to 0.496 (35.21% reduction, Fig. 5a), BA score declined from 0.8388 to

 0.6741

(19.64%

decrease,

Fig.

5b), AUC

decreased

from

0.9213

to

0.8169

(11.33%

 decline, Fig. 5c), while MCC dropped from 0.7071 to 0.44 (37.77% reduction, Fig. 5d).

 This phenomenon aligns with the fundamental pharmacological principle that payloads

 in

PDCs

serve

as

the

critical

determinant

for

tumor

cell

inhibition,

where

optimal

 payload selection is indispensable for designing efficacious PDCs. Secondarily, linker

 presence

significantly

impacted

model

performance

(Fig.

5),

as

linkers

fulfill

dual

 mechanistic roles of bridging peptides and payloads structurally, and enabling tumor

 microenvironment-responsive

payload

release

through

cleavable

bonds,

thereby

 establishing

linkers

as

non-negotiable

components

in

PDCs. The

absence

of

peptide

 17



 information,

that

is,

the

model's

performance

when

making

predictions

without

any

 input

of

peptide

sequences,

shows

a

smaller

decline

compared

to

the

former

two

 architectural

variants.

This

may

be

because

the

peptide

sequence

in

PDC

design

 primarily serves the targeting recognition function, and its structure itself is not the core

 determinant of molecular activity. Furthermore, the dual-channel peptide encoding in

 PDCNet

demonstrated

superior

feature

extraction

capabilities

compared

to

single-

channel

peptide

encoding,

directly

enhancing

predictive

performance.

Similar

 degradation trends were observed in other metrics (Fig. S1), including ACC and SE.

 Collectively,

these

ablation

study

results

scientifically

validate

the

necessity

and

 superiority of PDCNet architecture.

 AUC and MCC values of the test set, respectively.

 t-SNE dimensionality reduction visualization of PDCNet

 To

evaluate

whether

the

PDCNet

effectively

learns

discriminative

PDC

feature

 representations,

we

employed

t-SNE35

to

visualize

the

high-dimensional

features

 extracted by the model before and after training. Specifically, we reduced the features

 extracted by the PDCNet model on the PDC dataset to a two-dimensional space and

 compared the embedding distributions before and after training to observe the evolution

 of feature representation. As shown in Fig. 6a, before training, the active and inactive

 PDC

samples

were

distributed

in

a

messy

and

overlapping

manner

in

the

two-

dimensional

space,

with

no

clear

class

boundaries. This

indicates

that

the

untrained

 model was unable to

distinguish the

fused

features. After training, the

t-SNE results

 revealed a clearer trend of class clustering, with active and inactive samples forming

 separate distribution regions. This demonstrates that the model has successfully learned

 features related to activity and has developed strong discriminative capabilities.

 To further analyze the model's learning ability for samples with different structures,

 we selected two pairs of representative PDC samples for comparison. As shown in Fig.

 6b, the first pair of samples (PDC1 and PDC2) had highly similar structures. Before

 training, they were almost overlapping in the feature space, but after training, they were

 successfully distinguished and classified into different activity regions. This indicates

 that the model can capture subtle but critical structural differences and map them into

 deep features. Fig. 6c shows the second pair of samples (PDC3 and PDC4), which had

 significant

structural

differences.

Before

training,

they

were

distributed

in

a

discrete

 and

irregular

manner,

but

after

training,

they

were

accurately

classified,

 heterogeneous samples.

 Model interpretability analysis

 We

employed the SHAP (SHapley Additive

exPlanations) algorithm

to

conduct

 interpretability analysis on the four input features of the PDCNet model. As shown in

 Fig. 7a, the contributions of the three structural features (peptide, linker, and payload)

 are

generally

comparable,

with

values

of

0.79,

0.7,

and

0.8,

respectively.

This

 demonstrates that the PDCNet model comprehensively integrated the combined effects

 of

these

three

components

on

PDC

activity

during

the

modeling

process,

avoiding

 dependency bias towards any single module. These findings also indirectly verify the

 multiplicity of the SARs in PDCs,

highlighting that the

peptide, linker,

and

payload

 collectively determine the overall therapeutic performance.

 We selected three peptides of appropriate lengths. The first two peptides share the

 same

linker

and

payload,

differing

only

in

their

peptide

sequences,

while

the

third

 peptide was chosen entirely at random. Fig. 7b depicts the relative importance of amino

 acids for each peptide sequence, as determined by attention scores. The results show

 that positively charged amino acids, such as lysine and arginine, have higher attention

 scores, indicating that the model recognizes the significance of basic residues for PDC

 activity.

This

observation

aligns

with

the

hypothesis

that

their

cationic

properties

 enhance cell targeting or membrane permeability10, 36. Notably, amino acids proximal

 to the linker attachment displayed highest attention scores, suggesting that the PDCNet

 have identified the positions where peptides are connected to linkers.

 Supplementary Fig. S2.

 We selected three PDCs with identical peptides and payloads but different linkers

 to analyze the model's capacity to recognize linker-specific features. In Fig. 7c, color

 intensity denotes the magnitude of the attention weights, with darker colors indicating

 higher model attention. For the active PDC (PDC5, Fig. S2a), the model focuses more

 attention on the key functional group regions within the linker structure, particularly

 22





 near the carboxyl (-COOH) and thiol (-SH) groups. This demonstrates that the model

 can identify structural features highly associated with activity and assign them greater

 importance, thereby significantly influencing the final activity prediction. Conversely,

 the

linkers

of

the

inactive

PDCs

(PDC6

and

PDC7,

Fig.

S2b-c)

exhibit

different

 attention distribution characteristics: the attention is more dispersed, and key structural

 sites

such

as

functional

groups

or

regions

with

high

electron

density

do

not

receive

 significantly

higher

weights.

This

suggests

that

the

model

fails

to

capture

effective

 structural activity information from the linkers of inactive molecules or considers these

 structures to have a smaller contribution to the overall activity of PDC.



 Additionally, we selected a pair of PDCs with opposing activities that differ solely

 in

their

payloads

to

analyze

the

model's

capability

to

recognize

payload-specific

 features. The payload of active PDC8 (Fig. S2e) contains multiple hydroxyl (-OH) and

 carbonyl

(C=O)

functional

groups,

which

play

a

crucial

role

in

intermolecular

 interactions and may enhance the binding affinity of the molecule to its target. Moreover,

 these

hydroxyl

groups

can

form

hydrogen

bonds

with

water

molecules,

thereby

 increasing its water solubility and facilitating the conjugation of PDC37. In contrast, the

 fluorine atoms in the payload of inactive PDC9 (Fig. S2f) may enhance the lipophilicity

 of the molecule, potentially leading to non-specific binding and accumulation within

 the biological system, thereby reducing its activity.

 Independent

testing

based

on

a

new

external

dataset

in

real-word

application

 scenarios

 The aforementioned results have confirmed the robustness and stability of PDCNet,

 23



 we further evaluate its generalization capability in real-word application scenarios. To

 this end, awe collected an external dataset consisting of 21 novel PDCs from recently

 published literature and patents to conduct independent testing38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47.

 Details of these PDCs are provided in Supplementary Table 1.

 To demonstrate the dissimilarity between the peptides and drugs conjugates (PDCs)

 in the external dataset and the benchmark PDC dataset, we employed distinct similarity

 calculation methods based on the characteristics of peptides and small molecules. For

 peptides, we utilized global sequence similarity alignment from Biopython, comparing

 each peptide in the new PDCs with those in the original dataset pairwise, normalizing

 the alignment scores, and finally outputting the maximum similarity score. For linkers

 and payloads, we adopted the Tanimoto similarity calculation method based on ECFP_4

 fingerprints from RDKit, comparing each linker/payload in the new PDCs with those

 in the original dataset pairwise and outputting the maximum similarity score. Based on

 these similarity scores,

we calculated the harmonic mean of the similarity

scores for

 each new PDC. The results are shown in Table 2, with the minimum harmonic mean

 similarity score of the external dataset being 0.3600. This indicates the novelty of the

 external dataset, which can be used to validate the reliability and generalization ability

 of the PDCNet model.

 Discussion

 In this study, we proposed PDCNet, a unified deep learning framework based on

 the

standardized

PDC

benchmark

dataset

for

predicting

the

activity

of

PDCs.

By

 systematically

integrating

peptide

sequences,

linkers,

and

small

molecule

payload

 structures, PDCNet

demonstrated excellent performance in predicting the activity

of

 various PDC samples. The construction of the PDC benchmark dataset played a crucial

 role, providing high-quality and standardized data resources to support model training,

 validation, and objective performance evaluation.

 Although

PDCNet

was

primarily

trained

on

PDC

activity

data

in

the

field

of

 oncology and demonstrated good predictive ability in screening anti-cancer PDCs, its

 unified and

general

architecture design and feature extraction strategy mean that the

 model

is

not

limited

to

oncological

indications.

If

data

on

cell/target

activity

and

 corresponding

PDC

structures

related

to

other

diseases

(such

as

infections,

 inflammation, and metabolic diseases) are introduced, PDCNet can also perform cross-

disease activity prediction, showing good scalability and application potential. PDCNet

 has a unified and scalable framework that can effectively handle multimodal input data

 and can be flexibly expanded as the dataset continues to grow. This lays the foundation

 for its role as a basic tool for PDC activity research and helps to achieve PDC activity

 prediction tasks across targets and multiple disease fields in the future.

 Looking to the future, we plan to further refine and expand this research work in

 the

following

directions.

First,

we

will

continue

to

collect

and

integrate

the

latest

 published

PDC

structures

and

their

bioactivity

data

to

expand

the

PDC

benchmark

 27



 dataset, thereby enhancing the model's generalization ability and scope of application.

 Second,

to

more

comprehensively

capture

the

biological

context

information

that

 affects PDC activity, we will introduce more cellular biological features, such as target

 features,

to

achieve

more

accurate

activity

prediction.

In

addition,

we

also

plan

to

 combine generative deep learning techniques to develop an intelligent PDC molecule

 generation platform, realizing an integrated process from structural design to activity

 prediction, thus accelerating the innovation and optimization of novel PDC molecules.

 In summary, PDCNet, supported by a high-quality dataset and characterized by its

 unified and flexible model architecture, provides robust support for the computational

 prediction and rational design of PDCs. With the continuous expansion of data scale

 and feature dimensions, PDCNet is expected to play a more significant role in the

 future development of PDC drugs.

 Methods

 PDCs benchmark dataset construction

 As shown in Fig. 1b, the benchmark dataset employed in the PDCNet was derived

 from

two

distinct

sources:

published

academic

papers

and

the

PDCdb48.

Firstly,

a

 preliminary search was conducted in PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) using

 the keyword ‘Peptide drug conjugation’, resulting in the manual collection of structure

 and activity data for anticancer PDCs, amounting to a total of 767 entries. Additionally,

 we

collected

708

anticancer

PDCs

from

the

PDCdb.

The

two

datasets

were

 28





 subsequently combined and processed as follows: 1) duplicate entries were removed;

 2)

PDCs

with

complete

structure

information

were

retained,

including

peptide

 sequences, SMILES of linkers and SMILES of payloads; 3) the data were standardized,

 including

the

removal

of

data

containing

non-standard

amino

acids;

4)

unifying

the

 units of biological activity data at the cellular level to μM, including IC50, EC50, and

 GI50

(e.g.,

nM,

pM,

etc.);

5)

if

a

PDC

has

multiple

bioactivity

data,

retaining

and

 selecting the minimum testing value as the final value. Through the above processing,

 a total of 834 unique structures of PDCs were finally obtained.

 Subsequently,

the

data

were

categorized

as

follows:

1)

if

the

PDCs

were

in

the

 research status of marketing, clinical phase I, II and III, they were categorized as active;

 2) if the PDCs were under investigation and animal experiments were conducted, they

 were also labelled as active; 3) if the PDCs were under investigation and only cellular

 experiments were performed, they were categorized as active based on IC50, EC50, and

 GI50 values of <=1 μM, otherwise they were categorized as inactive; 4) if the PDCs

 were under investigation and no activity experiments have been performed, they

are

 also

labelled

as

negative.

Details

of

the

PDCs

benchmark

dataset

are

provided

in

 Supplementary Table 2. The benchmark dataset was then randomly divided into three

 non-overlapping subsets, with 80% allocated for training, 10% for validation, and 10%

 for testing.

 PDCNet architecture

 The architecture of PDCNet is shown in Fig. 1c. In general, it contains three main

 modules:

peptide

features

extraction

module,

linker

and

payload

features

extraction

 29



 module, and a multi-channel features

fusion and prediction module. Details of these

 three modules are described as the following.

 Peptide features extraction module

 To extract peptide features at PDCs, both amino acid- and peptide- level feature

 extractions were conducted (Fig. 1c, left). At the amino acid level, four encodings were

 performed for each amino acid following the input of the sequence containing one-hot

 encoding (20 dimensions), BLOSUM62 encoding (20 dimensions), positional encoding

 (20 dimensions), and Z-scale encoding (5 dimensions). This resulted in the amino acid

 encoding being transformed into a 65-dimensional feature vector

 . The entire

 peptide

sequence

can

thus

be

represented

as

a

time-series

matrix

 𝑥𝑥𝑡𝑡 ∈ 𝑅𝑅

65

,

which

is

 used

for

subsequent

sequence

modeling.

Next,

the

time-series

matrix

is

fed

into

the

 𝑋𝑋𝑃𝑃𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒

BiLSTM, generating a hidden state vector



 at each time step, thereby forming

 the

hidden

state

output

sequence



.

Subsequently,

the

self-attention

mechanism

is

 𝑒𝑒ℎ

ℎ𝑡𝑡 ∈ 𝑅𝑅

introduced, where the output sequence

 H



from the BiLSTM is used simultaneously as

 the Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) for the attention computation. This ultimately

 H

results in a 512-dimensional peptide local feature vector

 . The formula is as

 follows:

 Here,

 For another, Evolutionary Sequence Model 2 (ESM-2), a protein language model

 developed by the Meta AI team, was employed to extract peptide-level features49. This

 model

comprises

six

distinct

models

of

varying

complexity,

with

parameter

counts

 spanning from 8 million parameters to 15 billion parameters. The models in question

 range

from

a

48-layer

structure

with

5120

output

embeddings

to

smaller

models

 comprising just six layers and 320 output embeddings. We selected the pLM with 640

 output embeddings. Ultimately, amino acid-level and peptide-level features of peptide

 item of PDC are integrated with molecular features of linker and payload items of PDC

 underneath to generate predictions. Molecular characterizations for linker and payload

 of PDC are described as follows.

 Linker and payload features extraction module

 Recently, FG-BERT50, a generic self-supervised molecular representation learning

 model based on functional groups, has been developed in our group and can be fine-

tuned

to

downstream

drug

discovery

related

tasks,

such

as

molecular

properties

 prediction. Briefing, the model was trained on a corpus of approximately 1.45 million

 unlabeled

molecules.

Initially,

the

input

molecular

SMILES

were

converted

to

 molecular

graphs

using

the

RDKit.

Then,

functional

groups

were

masked

in

the

 molecular

graphs

to

facilitate

effective

large-scale

pre-training.

Finally,

chemical

 structure and semantic information were comprehensively mined

from the

corpus

to

 enable

the

learning of useful molecular

representations.

In this study,

we reasonably

 attribute

the

linkers

and

payloads

of

PDCs

to

small

molecule

terms

based

on

their

 structures,

and

use

a

fine-tuned

FG-BERT

model

to

obtain

feature

extraction

of

the

 31



 linkers and payloads (Fig. 1c, right). Given that the FG-BERT model exhibits superior

 performance in the evaluation of molecular properties, this enables accurate learning of

 useful feature representations of linkers and payloads of PDCs. As a consequence of

 this process, the small molecule structures of the linkers and payloads are transformed

 into

256-dimensional

feature

vectors,

which

are

then

subjected

to

subsequent

 processing.

 Multi-channel features fusion and prediction module

 According

to

the

well-designed

PDCNet

architecture,

the

peptide

portion

is

 obtained through dual channels with feature vectors



 and



at the amino acid- and

 peptide- levels, respectively. The linker and payload are then extracted by the FG-BERT

 𝑡𝑡1

 𝑡𝑡2

model,

resulting

in

feature

vector





for

the

linker

and

feature

vector





for

the

 payload. In the multi-channel feature and prediction module, these feature vectors are

PDCNet

model

has

been

developed

on

a

Python

and

TensorFlow-based

 framework51, which has been combined with a well-designed set of training strategies.

 32







 In the training phase, the dataset is divided into three parts: a training set, a validation

 set, and a test set. The training set is used to build the PDCNet model, the validation set

 is used to optimize the hyperparameters of PDCNet model, and the test set is employed

 to test the accuracy of the model. Three distinct random seeds (Fig. S4) are employed

 to facilitate the stochastic partitioning of the dataset, resulting in an 8:1:1 ratio. Upon

 loading the data, the model assumes a shared structure with independent output layers.

 PDCNet

employs

an

early-stopping

strategy

to

enhance

the

training

process

and

 circumvent overfitting, thereby augmenting its generalization capacity. The maximum

 number of training rounds was set to 50, with a tolerance of 10 for early stopping. In

 each training round, the model assesses and records AUC value of the validation set. In

 the event that the AUC value of the validation set does not demonstrate improvement

 after

10

consecutive

rounds

of

training,

the

training

process

will

be

terminated

 prematurely and the evaluation will be conducted on the test set. At the conclusion of

 each training cycle, the AUC value of the current validation set is evaluated to ascertain

 whether

it

surpasses

the

previous

optimal

record.

Subsequently,

the

current

model

 parameters are saved as the new optimal model. In the event that the aforementioned

 condition

is

not

met,

the

Early

Stop

Monitor

counter

is

incremented

by

one.

Upon

 reaching a total of 10, the training process is terminated and the test set is subsequently

 evaluated using the saved optimal model parameters. In the event that the early stop

 counter does not reach 10 following 50 rounds of training, the training is also terminated

 and

the

test

set

is

evaluated

instead.

The

early-stop

strategy

has

the

dual

benefit

of

 preventing

model

overfitting

during

training

while

also

conserving

computational

 33



 resources

and

time.

In

addition,

Hyperopt

and

Python-based

Bayesian

optimization

 techniques are employed as a means of optimizing and tuning the hyperparameters of

 the model. A total of 10 searches were conducted within a predefined parameter space

 with

the

objective

of

identifying

the

optimal

combination

of

hyperparameters

for

 achieving the best possible model performance.

 Baseline models construction and evaluation metrics

 With the aim of facilitating a comparative analysis of our PDCNet model with the

 baseline methods, we constructed eight baseline models. Notably, although these serve

 as baseline models for comparative

analysis, like PDCNet model, they

represent the

 first established models for predicting PDC anti-cancer activity. To our knowledge, no

 computational models have been previously developed specifically for PDC efficacy

 prediction in oncology research. In this study, four traditional ML algorithms, including

 RF52, SVM53, LR54, and XGBoost55were unitilzed to constructed these baseline models.

 Detials of these methods and models are briefly described in Supplementary note. The

 first three models are

integrated into

the scikit-learn package, whereas the XGBoost

 model is incorporated into the XGBoost Python library. Two molecular fingerprinting

 techniques are employed to characterise the linkers and payloads of the PDCs, namely

 a 166-bit

Molecular Access

Communication

System (MACCS) key56 and a 1024-bit

 Morgan

fingerprints57.

The

RF,

SVM,

LR,

and

XGBoost-based

models

synthesise

 features derived from molecular fingerprints and peptide chain sequences of linkers and

 payloads.

Finally,

PDCNet

and

these

baseline

models,

were

trainedd

on

a

GPU

 (NVIDIA Corporation GV100GL, Tesla V100 PCIe 32 GB) and CPU (Intel(R) Xeon(R)

 34



 Silver 4216 CPU @2.10 GHz).

 To comprehensively evaluate the predictive performance of PDCNet, ten standard

 metrics were employed as follows: accuracy (ACC), area under the receiver operating

 characteristic

curve

(AUC),

F1

score,

sensitivity

(SE),

specificity

(SP),

matthews

 correlation coefficient (MCC), precision-recall area under the curve (PRAUC), Positive

 predictive

value

(PPV)

and

negative

predictive

value

(NPV).

It

is

notable

that

the

 enhanced predictive power of the model corresponds to higher values of these metrics.

 The calculation of these evaluation metrics is outlined herewith:
