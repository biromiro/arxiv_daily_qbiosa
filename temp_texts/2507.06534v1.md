 # Introduction

 Melanoma

is

one

of the most

aggressive

and lethal forms

of

cancer,

characterized

by

rapid

 progression,

high

metastatic

potential,

and

significant

resistance

to

conventional

treatments,

 such

as

chemotherapy

and

immunotherapy1,2.

Despite

advances

in

targeted

therapies

and

 immune checkpoint inhibitors, their clinical success is often compromised by systemic toxicity,

 off-target

effects,

and

the

risk

of

drug

resistance3.

These

daunting

challenges

highlight

the

 urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies.

 A distinctive feature of melanoma cells is the overexpression of tyrosinase, a melanocyte-

specific

enzyme

central

to

melanin

biosynthesis4.

Tyrosinase

can

catalyze

the

oxidation

of

 tyrosine and its derivatives within melanoma cells, which makes the tyrosinase as a promising

 biomarker

and

activator for

tumor-specific

therapeutic

systems5.

Recent

advancements

have

 harnessed

tyrosinase

activity

to

develop

enzyme-responsive

systems,

such

as

prodrugs,

 nanoparticles, and pigment-mediated therapies6,7. These strategies primarily rely on tyrosinase-

mediated oxidation to activate therapeutic agents or induce localized nanoparticle aggregation

 within melanoma cells, thereby exerting cytotoxic effects through the generation of reactive

 oxygen

species

(ROS)

or

controlled

drug

release.

However,

the

dependence

on

exogenous

 payloads or intricate delivery systems presents substantial challenges in terms of scalability and

 clinical translation, ultimately constraining their broader applicability.

 Additionally,

the

actin

cytoskeleton,

a

critical

component

of

cellular

architecture

and

 function,

has

emerged

as

a

compelling

therapeutic

target8.

Actin

dynamics

regulates

key

 processes,

such

as

cell

motility,

proliferation,

and

adhesion,

which

are

essential

for

tumor

 invasion and metastasis9. Disrupting cytoskeletal dynamics represents a promising approach to

 impair these functions in cancer cells10. However, direct targeting cytoskeletal structures with

 tumor specificity has proven challenging, with existing strategies often hindered by off-target

 toxicity and insufficient therapeutic impact11.



 The discovery of the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) tripeptide sequence in the early 1980s marked

 a pivotal breakthrough in understanding cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions. The RGD

 sequence was found to serve as a universal recognition site for integrin receptors - a family of

 transmembrane

proteins

critical

for

cellular

processes

such

as

adhesion,

migration,

and

 signaling12,13. synthetic RGD peptides could competitively inhibit cell attachment to fibronectin,

 demonstrating the

sequence's

essential

role

in

integrin-mediated

binding.

Over the

past

four

 decades,

RGD

research

has

evolved

from

fundamental

biochemical

characterization

to

 sophisticated

biomedical

applications14.

Structural

analyses

elucidated

that

RGD-containing

 peptides adopt distinct conformations (cyclic vs. linear) that modulate integrin binding affinity

 and

specificity.

Notably,

cyclic

RGD

variants

demonstrated

enhanced

receptor

selectivity,

 driving their development as anti-angiogenic agents in cancer therapy15,16. Parallel advances in

 nanotechnology

and

biomaterials

leveraged

the

bio-adhesive

property

of

RGD

to

engineer

 functionalized scaffolds for tissue regeneration and targeted drug delivery systems15,17.

 Tyrosinase catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting steps of melanin synthesis, converting

 tyrosine

to

DOPA

and

subsequently

to

dopaquinoine.

Tyrosinase

is

highly

expressed

in

 melanoma

cells,

it

plays

a

significant

role

in

melanoma

pathogenesis4.

This

overexpression

 provides a unique opportunity for targeted therapies, as normal cells exhibit minimal tyrosinase

 activity, reducing off-target effects. We have designed a series of sequences involving tyrosine

 (Tyr) and lysine (Lys), which are crucial for controlling self-assembly and functionality. The

 mechanism

of

action,

driven

by

tyrosinase-catalyzed

oxidation

and

sequence-guided

self-

assembly,

enables

the

formation

of

fluorescent

or

melanin-like

nanostructures18-21.

By

 leveraging

the

unique

overexpression

of

tyrosinase

in

melanoma

cells,

an

unprecedent

 opportunity

arises

to

selectively

disrupt

cytoskeletal

dynamics

through

enzyme-triggered

 systems22. Such an approach should not only target key cellular processes but also address the

 limitations of current enzyme-responsive therapies by eliminating the need for external drug

 payloads and

complex

delivery mechanisms23,24.

This

strategy is

promising

for significantly

 enhancing

therapeutic

selectivity

while

minimizing

systemic

toxicity,

providing

a

novel

 framework for melanoma treatment.



 In this study, we introduce a novel cyclic peptide system (c-RGDKYQ) that leverages the

 overexpression

of tyrosinase

in

melanoma

cells to achieve

in

situ self-assembly.

The

cyclic

 peptide

is

synthesized

through

an

ortho-phthalaldehyde-mediated

cyclization

reaction

under

 mild aqueous conditions. Upon tyrosinase-catalyzed oxidation, c-RGDKYQ generates reactive

 quinone structures, which drives the formation of supramolecular nanostructures (Figure 1A).

 These nanostructures selectively disrupt the actin cytoskeleton dynamics within melanoma cells,

 impairing

cellular

motility,

proliferation,

and

adhesion,

and

ultimately

inducing

apoptosis

 (Figure

1B).

Notably,

this

approach

simplifies

the

therapeutic

design

and

facilitates

its

 translational potential. Both in vitro and in vivo experimental results validate the high selectivity

 of c-RGDKYQ for melanoma cells, demonstrating significant tumor growth suppression with

 minimal adverse effects. These findings, collectively, establish c-RGDKYQ as a robust and

 efficient framework for enzyme-responsive cancer therapies, specifically targeting melanoma

 and other tyrosinase-expressing tumors.

 2 | Results

 2.1 | Peptide Cyclization, Oxidation and Self-Assembly

 The cyclic peptide (c-RGDKYQ) was successfully synthesized using an ortho-phthalaldehyde

 (OPA)-mediated cyclization reaction (Figure 2A). First, we tested whether this peptide can be

 selectively activated by tyrosinase via undergoing oxidation and further self-assembly. After

 exposure to

tyrosinase, the

peptide

solution

color

changed from transparent

to

deep

yellow,

 indicating

the

formation

of

oxidative

products

and

nanostructures

(Figure

2B).

UV-vis

 spectroscopy revealed characteristic absorption peaks between 330 and 450 nm, corresponding

 to the formation of aromatic and quinone structures through tyrosinase-mediated oxidation of

 tyrosine residues (Figure 2C). Fluorescence spectroscopy showed a strong emission peak at 450

 nm

when

excited

at

340

nm,

confirming

the

structural

transformation

necessary

for

self-

assembly (Figure 2D).

which

the

the

 process,

not

in

samples

lacking

 tyrosinase (Figure. S1). FTIR indicates that the cyclization involving aromatic groups causes a

 change in the absorption of C-H out-of-plane bending vibrations in the benzene ring at 925

 cm−1. Both linear and cyclic peptides, under the catalysis of tyrosinase, exhibit oxidation and

 polymerization

of

the

phenolic

hydroxyl

group

on

the

tyrosine

amine,

as

evidenced

by

the

 reduction in characteristic FTIR peaks between 1138 and 1208 cm−1 and an increase of 1400

 cm−1 (Figure 2G). The tyrosinase-mediated oxidation of tyrosine residues to reactive quinones

 could

promote

intermolecular

crosslinking

and

the

formation

of

melanin-like

polymers

that

 subsequently

assemble

into

nanostructures

(Figure

This

transformation

 underscores the unique capability of the cyclic peptide to exploit the enzymatic environment of

 melanoma cells for selective activation and assembly.

 2.2 | Selective Cytotoxicity to Melanoma Cells

 The cytotoxic effects of the linear peptide (RGDKYQ) and its oxidized form (c-RGDKYQ)

 were systematically evaluated across melanoma cells (B16) and two other cell lines (L929 and

 U2OS). RGDKYQ exhibited negligible cytotoxicity at all tested concentrations in all cell lines.

 In

contrast,

c-RGDKYQ

demonstrated

a

concentration-dependent

cytotoxic

effect,

 significantly reducing cell viability in B16 melanoma cells but sparing the L929 and U2OS

 cells (Figure 3A-B). This selective cytotoxicity underscores the tyrosinase-mediated activation

 of

the

peptide

within

melanoma

cells,

which

overexpress

the

enzyme.

Morphological

 observations of B16 cells treated with c-RGDKYQ revealed dose-dependent cellular damage,

 including disruption of the cellular architecture and increased cell death (Figure 3E, S2). These

 findings align with the role of the oxidized cyclic peptide in impairing cytoskeletal integrity, a

 critical aspect of cellular survival and adhesion. Apoptosis analysis demonstrated that with the

 increase of c-RGDKYQ concentration, the number of apoptosis increased significantly (Figure

 3F, G).

 To

assess

the

impact

of

c-RGDKYQ

on

cell

motility,

a

wound-healing

assay

was

 performed on B16 melanoma cells. Untreated cells and cells exposed to RGDKYQ showed

 progressive wound closure over 24 hours. However, treatment with c-RGDKYQ effectively

 inhibited cell migration, as evidenced by the delayed wound closure compared to control groups

 (Figure

3H,

I).

These

results

demonstrate

that

the

oxidized

cyclic

peptide

disrupts

cellular

 motility, further supporting its anti-melanoma activity. Collectively, these findings demonstrate

 the

selective

cytotoxicity

and

anti-motility

effects

of

c-RGDKYQ

in

melanoma

cells,

 highlighting its potential for targeted melanoma therapy, while minimizing off-target effects in

 other cells.

 2.3 | Dynamic Disruption of Actin Cytoskeleton

 The effects of c-RGDKYQ on the actin cytoskeleton of B16 melanoma cells were investigated

 using fluorescence microscopy. In Ctrl group, phalloidin staining revealed intact actin filaments

 organized in dense, fibrous networks, reflecting normal cytoskeletal integrity (Figure 4A, B).

 In contrast, B16 cells treated with c-RGDKYQ for 24 hours displayed a striking disruption of

 actin

filaments.

The

fluorescence

intensity

of

phalloidin-stained

filaments

significantly

 decreased,

and

the

structural

organization

of

actin

filaments

appeared

fragmented

and

 disordered (Figure 4C, D). This disruption correlated with impaired cell spreading and adhesion,

 suggesting that c-RGDKYQ interferes with the dynamic remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.

 The observed effects can be attributed to the selective oxidation of peptide by tyrosinase, which

 generates reactive quinones that inhibit actin polymerization. A schematic representation of this

 mechanism (Figure 4E) illustrates how c-RGDKYQ disrupts cytoskeletal growth, leading to

 loss

of

cellular

structural

integrity

and

inducing

apoptosis

in

melanoma

cells.

The

severe

 reduction in actin filament organization is consistent with morphological abnormalities and loss

 of

cellular

adhesion

observed

in

previous

experiments.

The

above

results

show

that

c-

RGDKYQ can specifically target cytoskeletal components in melanoma cells, which takes the

 advantage of the high levels of tyrosinase expression in these tumor cells. By disrupting actin

 dynamics,

c-RGDKYQ

impairs

critical

cellular

processes,

such

as

motility

and

structural

 maintenance, contributing to its selective cytotoxic effects, indicating the therapeutic potential

 of targeting cytoskeletal dynamics in melanoma treatment.

 2.4 | Therapeutic Efficacy in a Murine Melanoma Model

 The therapeutic efficacy of c-RGDKYQ was assessed in a murine melanoma model using B16

 melanoma cells grafted into the right flank of mice. The mice were treated with peri-tumoral

 injections

of

saline

(Ctrl),

RGDKYQ,

or

c-RGDKYQ

according

to

the

schedule

shown

in

 Figure 5A. Body weight measurements throughout the study showed no significant differences

 between treatment groups, suggesting minimal systemic toxicity of c-RGDKYQ (Figure 5B).

 We

next

found that tumor growth

was

markedly

inhibited in the

c-RGDKYQ-treated

group

 compared to both the Ctrl and RGDKYQ-treated groups. Tumor volume measurements over

 time revealed pronounced suppression of tumor growth in the c-RGDKYQ group (Figure 5C).

 The

final

tumor

weights

further

confirmed

the

efficacy

of

c-RGDKYQ,

with

treated

mice

 exhibiting markedly smaller tumor masses than Ctrl (Figure 5D). Representative photographs

 of tumor-bearing mice and excised tumors illustrate the substantial tumor reduction achieved

 by c-RGDKYQ treatment (Figure 5E, F). Histological examination of tumor sections stained

 with H&E revealed significant differences in tumor architecture. c-RGDKYQ-treated tumors

 showed

increased

apoptotic

regions

and

reduced

cellular

density

compared

to

control

and

 RGDKYQ-treated

tumors

(Figure

5G),

consistent

with

the

in

vitro

experimental

results,

in

 which c-RGDKYQ disrupted actin cytoskeleton dynamics and induced apoptosis. Collectively,

 we

demonstrated the strong

antitumor

efficacy

of

c-RGDKYQ

in

vivo,

selectively targeting

 melanoma cells without causing systemic toxicity. The select activation of the cyclic peptide

 by tyrosinase and its subsequent therapeutic effects emphasize its potential as a highly specific

 and effective treatment for melanoma.

 3 | Discussion

 The designed cyclic peptide can leverage the overexpression of tyrosinase in melanoma cells

 to achieve selective activation and therapeutic effects. Through tyrosinase-mediated oxidation,

 the cyclic peptide undergoes a transformation into reactive quinone structures, leading to the

 formation of nanostructures that selectively disrupt melanoma cell actin cytoskeleton dynamics.

 This

targeted

disruption

impairs

critical

cellular

functions,

such

as

motility,

adhesion,

and

 proliferation, and ultimately inducing apoptosis. Our results underscore the effectiveness of c-

RGDKYQ for addressing key challenges in melanoma therapy, including tumor specificity and

 the limitations of conventional drug delivery systems.

 Research

demonstrates

that

the

RGD

sequence

regulates

interactions

of

intrinsically

 disordered region (IDR)-containing proteins via integrin receptor binding, influencing cellular

 signaling,

cytoskeletal

reorganization,

and

phase

separation.

Cyclic

RGD

peptides

exhibit

 enhanced binding affinity due to their stable conformation, activating FAK/Src/Rho GTPase

 pathways

to

strengthen

cell-matrix

adhesion

and

promote

dynamic

cytoskeletal

remodeling

 (e.g., actin polymerization), significantly boosting cell migration efficiency. This mechanism

 is critical in tumor invasion and angiogenesis, where cyclic RGD peptides enhance cancer cell

 penetration through basement membranes. Additionally, cyclic RGD peptides are utilized in

 tumor-targeted therapies and drug delivery systems by modulating cytoskeletal dynamics and

 phase

separation

within

the

tumor

microenvironment.

Functional

stability

and

therapeutic

 efficacy are further optimized through aromatic group modifications during cyclization.



 Here

in

vitro

experiments showed

that

c-RGDKYQ

selectively

inhibits the

viability

of

 B16 melanoma cells while sparing other cells (L929 and U2OS), highlighting its specificity for

 tyrosinase-expressing

cells.

This

specificity

was

further

validated

through

the

analysis

of

 cellular tyrosinase activity, which was significantly higher in B16 cells compared to the other

 cell

lines.

Importantly,

the

cyclic

peptide

not

only

demonstrated

cytotoxic

effects

but

also

 impaired cell motility, as evidenced by the wound-healing assays. The ability to simultaneously

 disrupt actin dynamics and impair migration suggests a potentially multi-faceted mechanism

 for

suppressing

melanoma

progression.

The

in

vivo

evaluation

of

c-RGDKYQ

in

a

murine

 melanoma model further supported its therapeutic potential. Tumor growth was significantly

 suppressed

in

the

c-RGDKYQ-treated

group,

with

treated

mice

showing

markedly

smaller

 tumor volumes and weights compared to the control and the group treated with the unoxidized

 peptide. The histological analysis revealed increased apoptotic regions and reduced cellularity

 in tumors from the c-RGDKYQ group, indicating effective induction of cell death within the

 tumor microenvironment. Critically, the treatment did not cause significant changes in body

 weight, suggesting minimal systemic toxicity.

 A key advantage of c-RGDKYQ system is its simplicity/feasibility and lack of reliance on

 external drug payloads or complex delivery vehicles. The cyclic peptide itself serves as both

 the

therapeutic

agent

and

the

responsive

system,

which

significantly

reduces

formulation

 complexity and enhances translational potential. Unlike conventional approaches that depend

 on nanoparticle carriers or prodrug formulations, c-RGDKYQ offers a streamlined therapeutic

 strategy with high tumor selectivity and minimal off-target effects. The selective disruption of

 the actin cytoskeleton, driven by the intracellular self-assembly of the oxidized peptide, is a

 particularly promising aspect of this work. By targeting cytoskeletal dynamics, c-RGDKYQ

 can directly interfere with processes essential for tumor cell survival and invasion, which aligns

 with emerging evidence highlighting the cytoskeleton as a critical therapeutic target in cancer.

 Moreover, targeting tyrosinase as a tumor-specific enzymatic trigger provides a robust platform

 for further development of enzyme-responsive therapeutic systems.

 4 | Conclusion

 In summary, c-RGDKYQ is successfully designed as a highly selective and potent therapeutic

 agent

for

melanoma,

capitalizing

on

the

overexpression

of

tyrosinase

in

melanoma

cells.

 Through enzyme-triggered oxidation and subsequent in situ self-assembly, the cyclic peptide

 selectively

disrupts

actin

cytoskeleton

dynamics,

leading

to

cancer

cell

apoptosis.

The

 demonstrated

efficacy

in

both

in

vitro and

in

vivo

experiments underscore its

potential

as

a

 targeted, tumor-specific treatment strategy. Notably, the

feasibility, specificity, and minimal

 systemic toxicity represent the translational potential of c-RGDKYQ for melanoma therapy.

 Future investigations will explore its applicability to other tyrosinase-expressing malignancies

 and further optimize delivery and efficacy in clinical settings.

 The peptide sequencing (RGDKYQ) was custom-synthesized by Top Peptide Biotechnology

 Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Tyrosinase (≥ 500 units/mg protein) and o-phthalaldehyde (OPA,

 molecular biology grade) were supplied by Sigma-Aldrich and purchased through Merck China

 Co., Ltd. All materials were used as received without further purification. Water was purified

 using

a

with

a

minimum

resistivity

of

18.2

 MΩ·cm.

 5.2 | Absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy

 Fluorescence spectroscopy was performed on a fluorescence spectrometer (Fluorolog®-MAX

 4, Horiba) equipped with a 1.0 cm quartz cuvette with a fixed excitation wavelength at 350 nm.

 Both excitation and emission slit widths were set 5.0 nm. The absorbance spectroscopy was

 performed on a microplate reader (BioTek Synergy H1).



 5.3 | Infrared spectrometry

 Infrared (IR) spectra were recorded on Nicolet iS5 FTIR spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific)

 with KBr pellets in the 4000 - 400 cm-1 regions.

 5.4 | Size and zeta potential

 Diameter and zeta potential measurements were performed using a dynamic light scattering

 (DLS) instrument, specifically the Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Panalytical Ltd.),

 equipped with a quartz cuvette. The experiments were conducted at a controlled temperature of



 25.0 °C over 100 consecutive scans. The samples were prepared in a sodium borate buffer (10

 mM, pH adjusted between 3 and 10) to ensure optimal conditions for accurate measurements.

 5.5 | High performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry

 High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses were conducted using an Agilent

 borate buffer (10 mM, pH 7). Detection was performed using a UV detector set at 280 nm and

 a fluorescence detector configured with an excitation wavelength of 350 nm and an emission

 wavelength of 500 nm.



 Following HPLC separation, mass spectrometry (MS) analysis was carried out to identify

 and quantify the compounds. The HPLC system was coupled online with a mass spectrometer

 (Agilent 6460 Triple Quadrupole LC/MS or equivalent), which operated in both positive and

 negative ion modes to maximize detection sensitivity. The electrospray ionization (ESI) source

 parameters

was

utilized to

assess

cell

 proliferation and viability. Log-phase B16, L929, and U2OS cells were dissociated using 0.25%

 trypsin to form single-cell suspensions. Cells were counted using a hemocytometer and adjusted

 to a concentration of 5 × 104 cells/mL in complete medium. A volume of 100 μL of the cell

 suspension was seeded into each well of a 96-well plate, with three replicates per condition.

 The plates were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ for

24 hours to allow for cell attachment.

 Following

incubation,

different

concentrations

of

the

test

drug

(three

concentration

groups)

 were added to the wells. Each treatment group had three replicates. After 12 hours, images were

 captured under a microscope to document initial cell viability. For B16 cells, the 96-well plates

 were further incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ for an additional 24 hours. Subsequently, 10 μL

 of CCK-8 reagent was added to each well, gently mixed, and the plates were incubated for 2.5

 hours

under

the

same

condition.

Absorbance

values

were

measured

at

450

nm

using

a

 microplate reader (U-2900, Hitachi). Data were recorded, and the percentage of cell viability

 was calculated. Origin software was used for data analysis to generate cell viability curves and

 determine the half-maximal inhibitory concentration.

 5.7 | Wound healing assay for cell migration

 To evaluate the effects of Control, RGDKYQ, and cRGDKYQ on cell migration, a classical

 wound healing assay was performed. B16 cells in logarithmic growth phase were seeded at a

 density of 2 × 10⁵ cells per well in 6-well plates and cultured in DMEM medium supplemented

 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ until

 they

reached

90%-100%

confluency.

Cells

were

then

starved

in

serum-free

medium

for

24

 hours to synchronize the cell cycle and minimize non-specific migration. Next, a straight line

 was gently scratched in the center of each well using a 200 μL pipette tip, creating a uniform

 "cell-free zone,"

followed by

twice

washes

with

PBS

to

remove

unattached

cell

debris.

For

 treatment, the control group received normal culture medium, the RGDKYQ group was treated

 with

a

final

concentration

of

0.1

mg/mL,

and

the

cRGDKYQ

group

received

a

final

 concentration

of

0.1

mg/mL.

Images

of

the

scratch

areas

in

the

center

of

each

well

were

 captured

at

0,

12,

and

24 hours

using

an

inverted

microscope

(OLYMPUS

DP74), ensuring

 consistent

imaging

positions.

The

changes

in

scratch

width

at

different

time

points

were

 measured using ImageJ software to calculate relative migration distances or percent closure of

 the scratch. Statistical analysis was performed using T-tests or ANOVA to compare differences

 between the three groups, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.

 5.8 | Flow cytometry assay for apoptosis analysis

 Flow cytometry was employed to analyze cell cycle progression and apoptosis. B16 cells in the

 logarithmic growth phase were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 10⁵ cells per well.

 After reaching 70–80% confluency, cells were synchronized by serum starvation for 24 hours.

 Subsequently, the cells were treated with Control and cRGDKYQ (0 mg/mL, 50 mg/mL, 100

 mg/mL and 200 mg/mL) for 24 hours. The Apoptosis Analysis was performed using Annexin

 V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Detection Kit (Catalog No. K2003, Weihuan Biotechnology Co., Ltd.)

 following

the

manufacturer’s

protocol.

Stained

cells

were

diluted

with

500

μL

buffer

and

 analyzed

immediately

on

a

CytoFlex

Flow

Cytometer

(Beckman

Coulter). A

minimum

of

 50,000 events per sample were acquired, and data were processed with CytExpert Software

 (v2.4). Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with T-test (p < 0.05; n =

 3 independent experiments, triplicate wells).

 5.9 | Observation and analysis of cytoskeletal structure

 Cells were cultured in 24-well plates and until reaching approximately 70-80% confluency. The

 cells

were

maintained

in

DMEM

medium

supplemented

with

10%

FBS

and

1%

penicillin-

streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO₂ incubator. Cells were gently washed twice with pre-cooled

 PBS,

each

for

5

minutes.

Fixation

was

performed

by

adding

4%

paraformaldehyde

(PFA)

 solution

and

incubating

at

room

temperature

for

15

minutes.

Following

fixation,

cells

were

 washed twice with pre-cooled PBS, each for 5 minutes. To allow the dye to penetrate the cell

 membrane, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 solution at room temperature for

 5 minutes. Non-specific binding sites were blocked by incubating the cells with PBS containing

 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 minutes at room temperature. Cells were then stained

 with a PBS solution containing Alexa Fluor 488-labeled Phalloidin diluted 1:100 and incubated

 for 30 minutes in the dark. Phalloidin specifically binds to F-actin, labeling the actin filaments

 of the cytoskeleton. After staining, cells were washed three times with PBS, each for 5 minutes.

 For

nuclear

staining,

cells

were

incubated

with

a

PBS

solution

containing

DAPI

(4',6-

diamidino-2-phenylindole) diluted 1:1000 for 10 minutes in the dark at room temperature. Cells

 were

washed

again

three

times

with

PBS,

each

for

5

minutes.

Coverslips

were

carefully

 removed and inverted onto glass slides containing an anti-fade mounting medium, sealing the

 edges with nail polish. Fluorescence images were captured using a ZEISS Axio Observer A1

 microscope

equipped

with

appropriate

filters.

F-actin

fluorescence

was

observed

under

 excitation at 488 nm, while DAPI fluorescence was detected under excitation at 358 nm. High-

resolution images were taken for subsequent analysis.

 5.10 | Effect of cRGDKYQ on the viability of B16 melanoma cells

 To examine the effect of cRGDKYQ on the viability of B16 melanoma cells, log-phase B16

 cells were utilized. B16 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells per well in 24-well plates,

 with 500 μL of complete DMEM medium (containing 10% fetal bovine serum) added to each

 well. The cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ for 24 hours to allow for attachment and

 growth. cRGDKYQ was dissolved in sterile physiological saline to prepare solutions of varying

 concentrations (0, 40, 80, 200 µg/mL). After the initial 24-hour culture period, the cells in the

 24-well plates were treated with these different concentrations of cRGDKYQ solution for an

 additional

24

hours.

The

control

group

received

only

sterile

physiological

saline

without

 cRGDKYQ.

Following

the

24-hour

treatment,

cells

were

gently

washed

twice

with

PBS

to

 remove residual cRGDKYQ solution. Calcein AM was diluted in serum-free DMEM to a final

 concentration

of

2

μM,

and

propidium

iodide

(PI)

was

diluted

to

a

final

concentration

of

1

 μg/mL. Each well received 200 μL of this staining solution and was incubated in the dark for

 30 minutes. Cells were then washed twice with PBS. Fluorescence images were captured using

 a

confocal

laser

scanning

microscope

(Nikon

A1,

Japan),

with

appropriate

excitation

and

 emission wavelengths: Calcein AM (excitation 488 nm, emission 515 nm) for live cells and PI

 (excitation

535

nm,

emission

617

nm)

for

dead

cells.

Images

were

taken

under

identical

 conditions for all groups. Green fluorescence indicated live cells stained by Calcein AM, while

 red fluorescence represented dead cells stained by PI.

 5.11 | In vivo efficacy validation experiment

 To evaluate the inhibitory effects of a cyclic peptide drug on B16 melanoma cells in nude mice,

 the following standardized protocol was employed: B16 melanoma cells were used. Cells were

 dissociated using trypsin and resuspended to form a single-cell suspension. Cell concentration

 was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/mL using a hemocytometer for accurate counting. Cells were then

 re-suspended in serum-free DMEM medium (Gibco) to achieve a final concentration of 1 × 106

 cells/200 μL. A volume of 200 μL cell suspension was inoculated subcutaneously into the right

 dorsal side of 7-week-old female nude mice. Each group consisted of 5 nude mice, including a

 control

group

and

an

experimental

group.

Post-inoculation,

the

body

weight

and

tumor

 formation of the nude mice were monitored daily, and tumor growth was recorded. Noticeable

 tumor

formation

was

observed

within

7-10

days

post-inoculation.

Tumor

dimensions

were

 measured

using

calipers,

recording

the

longest

diameter

(a)

and

shortest

diameter

(b),

and

 calculating tumor volume using the formula V = ab²/2. The cyclic peptide and its non-cyclic

 counterpart were dissolved in sterile physiological saline and administered at a concentration

 of 7.5 mg/kg. The control group received an equivalent volume of sterile physiological saline.

 Starting from day 7 after visible tumor formation, injections were administered every three days

 for a total of four injections. Before and after each injection, the body weight and tumor volume

 of the nude mice were recorded to assess the drug's effect on tumor growth inhibition. Survival

 times were also documented to evaluate the impact of the drug on survival rates. Seven days

 after the last injection, the nude mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation, and tumor tissues

 were excised, weighed, and prepared for further histological and molecular biological analysis.

 Data

analysis

was

performed

using

Origin

software.

Comparisons

between

the

control

and

 experimental groups were made regarding tumor volume, changes in body weight, and survival

 rates. Statistical analyses were conducted using T-tests and ANOVA to determine significant

 differences.

 5.12 | Morphological observation of lung and tumor tissues

 To evaluate the inhibitory effects of the cyclic peptide drug on B16 melanoma cells in nude

 mice and its impact on lung tissue, the following protocol was employed for morphological

 assessment: Upon euthanizing the nude mice, tumor and lung tissues were promptly excised

 and gently rinsed with PBS. All tissues were fixed in paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin,

 sectioned (Leica RM2255, Germany), and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Finally,

 the HE-stained sections were examined and imaged using an optical microscope (Pannoramic

 MIDI, Hungary). Histopathological evaluation of the tumor and lung tissue sections focused on

 cellular

morphology,

tissue

architecture,

and

inflammatory

responses,

providing

detailed

 descriptions of these features.
