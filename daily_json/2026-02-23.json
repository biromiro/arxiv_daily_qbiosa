        "title": "KEMP-PIP: A Feature-Fusion Based Approach for Pro-inflammatory Peptide Prediction",
        "summary": "Pro-inflammatory peptides (PIPs) play critical roles in immune signaling and inflammation but are difficult to identify experimentally due to costly and time-consuming assays. To address this challenge, we present KEMP-PIP, a hybrid machine learning framework that integrates deep protein embeddings with handcrafted descriptors for robust PIP prediction. Our approach combines contextual embeddings from pretrained ESM protein language models with multi-scale k-mer frequencies, physicochemical descriptors, and modlAMP sequence features. Feature pruning and class-weighted logistic regression manage high dimensionality and class imbalance, while ensemble averaging with an optimized decision threshold enhances the sensitivity--specificity balance. Through systematic ablation studies, we demonstrate that integrating complementary feature sets consistently improves predictive performance. On the standard benchmark dataset, KEMP-PIP achieves an MCC of 0.505, accuracy of 0.752, and AUC of 0.762, outperforming ProIn-fuse, MultiFeatVotPIP, and StackPIP. Relative to StackPIP, these results represent improvements of 9.5% in MCC and 4.8% in both accuracy and AUC.
