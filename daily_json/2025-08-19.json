        "summary": "Recent advances in machine learning force fields (MLFF) have significantly\nextended the capabilities of atomistic simulations. This progress highlights\nthe critical need for reliable reference datasets, accurate MLFFs, and,\ncrucially, efficient active learning strategies to enable robust modeling of\ncomplex chemical and materials systems. Here, we introduce aims-PAX, an\nautomated, multi-trajectory active learning framework that streamlines the\ndevelopment of MLFFs. Designed for both experts and newcomers, aims-PAX offers\na modular, high-performance workflow that couples flexible sampling with\nscalable training across CPU and GPU architectures. Built on the widely adopted\nab initio code FHI-aims, the framework seamlessly integrates with\nstate-of-the-art ML models and supports pretraining using general-purpose (or\n\"foundational\") models for rapid deployment in diverse systems. We demonstrate\nthe capabilities of aims-PAX on two challenging systems: a highly flexible\npeptide and bulk CsPbI$_3$ perovskite. Across these cases, aims-PAX achieves a\nreduction of up to two orders of magnitude in the number of required reference\ncalculations and enables over 20x speedup in AL cycle time through optimized\nresource utilization. This positions aims-PAX as a powerful and versatile\nplatform for next-generation ML-driven atomistic simulations in both academic\nand industrial settings.",

        "summary": "The prediction of amyloidogenicity in peptides and proteins remains a focal\npoint of ongoing bioinformatics. The crucial step in this field is to apply\nadvanced computational methodologies. Many recent approaches to predicting\namyloidogenicity within proteins are highly based on evolutionary motifs and\nthe individual properties of amino acids. It is becoming increasingly evident\nthat the sequence information-based features show high predictive performance.\nConsequently, our study evaluated the contextual features of protein sequences\nobtained from a pretrained protein large language model leveraging\nbidirectional LSTM and GRU to predict amyloidogenic regions in peptide and\nprotein sequences. Our method achieved an accuracy of 84.5% on 10-fold\ncross-validation and an accuracy of 83% in the test dataset. Our results\ndemonstrate competitive performance, highlighting the potential of LLMs in\nenhancing the accuracy of amyloid prediction.",
