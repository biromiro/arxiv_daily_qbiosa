        "summary": "Controllable image synthesis, which enables fine-grained control over\ngenerated outputs, has emerged as a key focus in visual generative modeling.\nHowever, controllable generation remains challenging for Visual Autoregressive\n(VAR) models due to their hierarchical, next-scale prediction style. Existing\nVAR-based methods often suffer from inefficient control encoding and disruptive\ninjection mechanisms that compromise both fidelity and efficiency. In this\nwork, we present SCALAR, a controllable generation method based on VAR,\nincorporating a novel Scale-wise Conditional Decoding mechanism. SCALAR\nleverages a",
