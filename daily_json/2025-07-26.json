        "summary": "We present DINO-world, a powerful generalist video world model trained to\npredict future frames in the latent space of DINOv2. By leveraging a\npre-trained image encoder and training a future predictor on a large-scale\nuncurated video dataset, DINO-world learns the temporal dynamics of diverse\nscenes, from driving and indoor scenes to simulated environments. We show that\nDINO-world outperforms previous models on a variety of video prediction\nbenchmarks, e.g. segmentation and depth forecasting, and demonstrates strong\nunderstanding of intuitive physics. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to\nfine-tune the predictor on observation-action trajectories. The resulting\naction-conditioned world model can be used for planning by simulating candidate\ntrajectories in latent space.",
