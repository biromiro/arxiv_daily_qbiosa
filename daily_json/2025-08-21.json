        "title": "PepThink-R1: LLM for Interpretable Cyclic Peptide Optimization with CoT SFT and Reinforcement Learning",
        "summary": "Designing therapeutic peptides with tailored properties is hindered by the\nvastness of sequence space, limited experimental data, and poor\ninterpretability of current generative models. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce PepThink-R1, a generative framework that integrates large language\nmodels (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning and\nreinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior approaches, PepThink-R1 explicitly\nreasons about monomer-level modifications during sequence generation, enabling\ninterpretable design choices while optimizing for multiple pharmacological\nproperties. Guided by a tailored reward function balancing chemical validity\nand property improvements, the model autonomously explores diverse sequence\nvariants. We demonstrate that PepThink-R1 generates cyclic peptides with\nsignificantly enhanced lipophilicity, stability, and exposure, outperforming\nexisting general LLMs (e.g., GPT-5) and domain-specific baseline in both\noptimization success and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first\nLLM-based peptide design framework that combines explicit reasoning with\nRL-driven property control, marking a step toward reliable and transparent\npeptide optimization for therapeutic discovery.",

        "explanation": "The paper introduces PepThink-R1, a generative model for cyclic peptide design that leverages large language models (LLMs). It uses chain-of-thought (CoT) supervised fine-tuning & reinforcement learning (RL) to explicitly reason about monomer-level modifications, which enhances interpretability. The model is trained to optimize multiple pharmacological properties, guided by a reward function balancing chemical validity and property improvements. Results demonstrate significant improvements in lipophilicity, stability, and exposure compared to general LLMs and domain-specific baselines. The approach is claimed to be the first LLM-based peptide design framework to combine explicit reasoning with RL-driven property control.",
        "interests_alignment": "This paper strongly aligns with my research interests. It focuses on peptide design and optimization using machine learning, a core area of my interest. The application of LLMs to peptides, the consideration of multiple properties, and the emphasis on interpretability are all highly relevant. The specific focus on cyclic peptides and their optimization also aligns with my interests in peptide self-assembly and aggregation due to their constrained structures.",
