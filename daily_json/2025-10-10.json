        "title": "Transferable Generative Models Bridge Femtosecond to Nanosecond Time-Step Molecular Dynamics",
        "summary": "Understanding molecular structure, dynamics, and reactivity requires bridging\nprocesses that occur across widely separated time scales. Conventional\nmolecular dynamics simulations provide atomistic resolution, but their\nfemtosecond time steps limit access to the slow conformational changes and\nrelaxation processes that govern chemical function. Here, we introduce a deep\ngenerative modeling framework that accelerates sampling of molecular dynamics\nby four orders of magnitude while retaining physical realism. Applied to small\norganic molecules and peptides, the approach enables quantitative\ncharacterization of equilibrium ensembles and dynamical relaxation processes\nthat were previously only accessible by costly brute-force simulation.\nImportantly, the method generalizes across chemical composition and system\nsize, extrapolating to peptides larger than those used for training, and\ncaptures chemically meaningful transitions on extended time scales. By\nexpanding the accessible range of molecular motions without sacrificing\natomistic detail, this approach opens new opportunities for probing\nconformational landscapes, thermodynamics, and kinetics in systems central to\nchemistry and biophysics.",
